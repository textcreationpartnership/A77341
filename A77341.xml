         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:169298:3"/>thus the malice and venome of an enemy too may by wiſdom be converted into a medicine, and by managing become a benefit, which was by him intended for an injury, or to uſe the ſimilitude of <hi>Plutarch,</hi> as healthy and ſtrong beaſts do eate and concoct Serpents, whereas weak ſtomacks do nauſeate at delicates, ſo wiſe men do exceedingly profit by the hatred of their enemies, whereas fools are corrupted with the love of their friends, and an injury doth one man more good, than a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie doth another, as wind and thunder, when they trouble the ayre, do withall purge it, whereas a long Calm doth diſpoſe it unto putrifaction, the ſame whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone that takes from a weapon doth likewiſe give it an edge,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 13.30.</note> and ſharpens it, as the Iſraelites when there was no Smith amongſt them, <hi>1 Sam. 13.30.</hi> did ſharpen their inſtruments with the Philiſtims; ſo an enemy ſerves to quicken and put an edge upon thoſe vertues which by lying unexerciſed may contract ruſt and dulneſſe, and many times when the reaſons of the thing it ſelf cannot perſwade, the fear of giving advantage will over-rule a man, lest hereby he gives his foe matter of inſultation, the eye and neereneſſe of an Adverſary exciteth Caution and diligence, and makes a mans life more fruitfull and orderly then otherwiſe it would have been; like a ſink by a houſe ſide it makes all the houſe the cleaner, as thoſe Roſes and Violets are ſweeteſt which grow neer unto Garlick, and other ſtrong ſented Herbs, becauſe theſe draw away to them any fetid or noxious non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment: and as vermine do ever devour the pureſt Corn, and moaths eate into the fineſt Cloath, and the Cautharides blaſts the ſweteſt flowers, ſo envie doth ever gnaw upon that which is moſt beautifull in another whom it hateth, poyſon never works, where it finds no heat; envie ſtill follows the better part, as the Vulture it draws ſickneſſe from a perſum, a rancorous nature, trouble, from the good it ſees in him he hateth; and <hi>odiorum acriores cauſae quando iniquae,</hi> when hatred is built upon a bad foundation it commonly raiſeth it ſelf the higher, and the reaſon is becauſe in paſsions of this nature, the leſſe we have from the object, the more we have from our ſelves, and what is defective to make up malice in the demerit of him whom we hate, it ſupplyed by the raiſing of our own ſtomacks; as we ſee in the body that thin and empty nouriſhment, will more often ſwell it then that which is ſubſtantiall; but after the greateſt inundation the waters are dryed up, the ſubtilleſt lightning hath but his flaſh; the ratling thunder-bolt hath but his clap: In the fulneſſe of time the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhall return out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the mean time we muſt awaite Gods leiſure with patience,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.41.</note>

But the next news that I heard of him was, that when I was to have brought in my Exerciſe for the bar in <hi>Lincolns Inne,</hi> whereof I was a Member, I was required to forbear; whereupon tendring a Certificate of my conformity, and performance of my Exerciſes, and payment of all Duties in the houſe as others, I deſired to have a like equall favour with the reſt of my fellows, that were at that time called with my ſelf, but for a time I was refuſed, without any publike cauſe or reaſon ſhewn unto me for the ſame: then addreſsing my ſelf to Master <hi>William Noye,</hi> then one of the Benchers of the houſe, a man then in great eſteeme and opinion with the people, both for his learning and integrity, and a great lover of Truth and Juſtice; he told me plainly, The cauſe of this ſtay proceeded from a meſſage ſent to them of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of that houſe, from that Lord Chief Juſtice, that I had injured him in ſome things, for which he deſired ſatisfaction before I were admitted to the Bar (and other cauſe to do this to my remembrance I never gave him, then as aforeſaid) but Maſter <hi>Noye</hi> ſo laboured the matter in my behalf, as at laſt the reſtraint upon me was taken off, and I performed my Exerciſe and proceeded accordingly: And not long afterwards one <hi>Edmund Bullocke</hi> Eſquire, an <hi>Utter Barreſter</hi> at Law, of the ſame Houſe, and my ancient for ſome years, and my next Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Country, being grieved at the proſperity which God bleſſed me withall, and thinking that I began to bud too faſt in my Profeſsion, by the wayes and helps which God afforded me; therefore extreamly maligned me, uſed many Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſpeeches of me behinde my back, to my diſparagement, ſuch as were Actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, thinking to have nipt me in the bloſſome; and for which words I afterwards brought my Action at Law againſt him, whereby he perceiving himſelf pinched to the quick, and faln in danger of a Councell, as ſure to be overthrown with good dammages to be given me for the words, as to ſuffer in his credit and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo, <hi>that knowing his Maſters will, yet would offend againſt it, to be beaten with many ſtripes;</hi> therefore in the interim before the Tryall, he
<pb facs="tcp:169298:4"/>raked up ſome accuſations againſt me in the Country, and thereupon petitioned the then Lord Chiefe Justince <hi>Ley</hi> to have them heard at the ſaid aſsizes with my <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> and thus did raiſe a divertive war, an old trick of <hi>Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells,</hi> to keep his enemy from his own quarters, wherein if not to proſper with a victory, yet to raiſe it as a means to accompliſh ſome Propoſitions of Peace at leaſt; and herein he had by the help and countenance of my good friend this Lord Chief Juſtice that I told you of before, who underhand dealt with his brethren, and thoſe of mine own Coat and Country, for their aſsiſtance to Maſter <hi>Bullock</hi> in this Action, by which means too, Maſter <hi>Bullock</hi> had the happineſſe to be taken notice of more than ever in his life before, and to gaine that countenance and reſpect, which for many yeers before he was without (and to deviate a little) I pray obſerve this much by the way, by this, and that which follows, it hath been moſt mens haps, that have ever done me wrong, when I ſought a legall repair at their hands, they evermore have found means by the helpe of power and greatneſſe to ſave themſelves and be protected, and gain alſo great acquaintance and preferments into the bargaine: but it is no wonder, for as one ſtar riſeth another muſt fall, as one ſea floweth, another ebbs; when <hi>Rachel</hi> dyeth, <hi>Benjamin</hi> is brought forth: amongſt men of the ſame abilities, one is many times thought diſadvantagious to the other: ſtarrs that do agree in light and qualities, the ſmalleſt ſuffers loſſe by the brightneſſe of them above, as one Tradeſmans profit, is made leſſe by the other: that thus I am ſure, by my fals, I have been ſet for the riſing of many, the moſt and greateſt of which notwithſtanding, I have lived to ſee God Almighty taken revenge upon: but to proceed, M. <hi>Bullock</hi> to ſave his ſtake, was apt to follow any adviſe, might ſave himſelf, and preferred a Petition to the ſaid then Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Ley,</hi> against me accordingly, as I ſaid before, ſuppoſing in Generalls many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours I ſhould have committed in the exerciſe of my Office of Steward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and gained a reference upon it unto two Juſtices of the Peace in the Country, and which was in effect giving them power to receive any complaints that ſhould come in againſt me; and the common ſort of people being now thereof informed who like tinder, are apt to take fire with every Spark, were ſome of them drawn and perſwaded for to complain, but without cauſe, all which were firſt prepared in the Country, and after appointed to be heard at the ſame Aſsizes before the Judges, before whom my action againſt him was alſo to be tryed: and now theſe Juſtices of the Peace had made a certificate for the purpoſe, but I muſt tell you, that moſt of the Juſtices of the Peace, thought themſelves to be jolly Judges, at that time, and ruled the Country as little Kings in their Dominions, all was fiſh that came into their nets, and their Warrants flew abroad as Bees in July, betwixt party and party, and in whatſoever other thing, though it were beſides their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and whereof they had not Cognizance, it made no matter: if any man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the boldneſſe to be at Action with them for any ſuch miſcarriage or wrong doing, they had every one their relations and dependances to ſome great Officer or States man here above, who put them in Commiſsion, to do their turnes, that by a Petition at Councell Table, or before themſelves, would convent their adverſaries, and have their wills of them by hook or by crook; and to ſpeak the truth, thoſe that guided at the Helm of State, and had their deſignes laid for introducing of an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall Government at that time; it was a part of their work to indeer all the Gentry of the Kingdomes unto their ſide, by making them Juſtices of the Peace, and imploying them in Commiſsions for the Kings occaſians, and by putting them in Offices and places under his Majeſty and themſelves, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils great pollicy to offer men the kingdomes of this world to catch them at the laſt:
<pb facs="tcp:169298:5"/>the more for to prepare and fit them for their hands, that very few were left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged, as now we finde it true, by too wofull experience, how mainly they have obſtructed and ſtill do the work of Reformation; and if there were any man whom God had bleſſed with more than an ordinary underſtanding or with power in his Country, and who that for Conſcience ſake would not be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſide with that party, and run into the ſame exceſſe of riot and diſorder with themſelves, ſuch were ſure to be oppoſed, oppreſſed, and perſecuted every way unto ruine and deſtruction; but to proceed: Upon this Certificate of the ſaid referrees, this matter was firſt cauſed to be called upon in the publike face of the County at the ſaid Aſsizes, and all that Rebell rout and crew, which had been ſo mustred up and gathered together, came with open mouth to charge me before that great aſſembly: but the accuſations being read, and my anſwers received, the Complaints appeared to be ſo poor and frivolous, and ſo falſe and ſcandalous, as that my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers were aſhamed of the proſecution, and then means was made to the then Lords Juſtices of Aſsizes, the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Ley,</hi> and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> that they would take up the matter of Difference betwixt Maſter <hi>Bullocke</hi> and my ſelf, that ſo my tryall might not go on and proceed againſt him; which upon motion of the Judges, I condeſcended unto, and they were pleaſed to make peace betwixt us: And I cannot forget the good Counſell which my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Ley</hi> gave unto me at that time in his Chamber privately between him and me, adviſing me for the Future to be evermore of the Defenſive part, which, ſaith he, like an hedge-hog will leave thine Adverſary nothing but prickles to fight againſt; ſaying, if I ſhould have ſought repair, and to have righted my ſelf by law, of every one that hath done me injury by words and deeds, I had had enough to do to right my ſelf, and ſhould never have ſate in the place where now I ſit; which from that time you will perceive by that which followeth, I have obſerved as much as poſsible. There was one at this time alſo that was an Atturney at the Common Law, that dieted and lodged in my houſe, who in the courſe of his practiſe, had omitted to file an Originall Writ for his Client, which was in an Action of debt upon an Obligation of <hi>200. l.</hi> which Sute being proceeded unto Judgement, was afterwards reverſed for want of this Writ to warrant the Action; and becauſe a ſine of twenty ſhillings was to have been paid for that Writ if it had been ſued forth, this Atturney was therefore called in queſtion, before the then Lord Chiefe Juſtice of the Common Pleas, and the matter mightily preſſed as if it had been done by my direction, and omitted to be ſued forth on purpoſe to have ſhared the ſaid fine between us, a thing you ſee but of petty conſideration, yet if it could have been made good againſt me, an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was threatned to have been preferred againſt me into the Court of Star-Chamber: but when it was fully examined and perceived that I had nothing to do with it, preſently he was let alone, and nothing done unto him afterwards for it, who at firſt was threatned with Impriſonment, if not to confeſſe me guilty with himſelf, yet for this ſuppoſition of an Offence, I was bound over from time to time, from place to place, and vexed to the uttermoſt, and after quit without any reparation. Then as men that ſhear Hoggs, you ſee unto this time, here was a great cry, but little wooll, yet this advantaged Maſter <hi>Bullock</hi> in that he ſought for at the Aſsizes, but never wrought that upon him, which he was enjoyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Judges, a perfect reconciliation, that we ſhould have lived in Peace and good Neighbour-hood together for the time then to come; but the old Proverb was herein verified, <hi>The Devil being ſick, the Devil a Monk would be; But the Devil being well, the Devill a Monk was he.</hi> For the Sceane
<pb facs="tcp:169298:5"/>being ended, and the fetters taken off, the man was no more a priſoner, and there was nothing that came in his way afterwards that concerned me, wherein he could do me a diſcourteſie, I may ſay a miſchiefe, but he imbraced the opportunity as a mercy, with much gladneſſe of heart, which I mention not that he had power or meanes to do me very much hurt, but to let you ſee this other Proverb herein ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled alſo, That a reconciled enemy is never after to be truſted, for the poyſon will remaine untill the beaſt be killed; and therefore beaſts of prey that are by nature ravenous, and not to be reclaimed, we kill, as Foxes we knock on the head; onely to beaſts of pleaſure we give Laws, as to Deer and Hares, &amp;c. For Serpents onely begets Serpents; and in that buſineſſe between <hi>Yates</hi> and me, the occaſion of the enſuing diſcourſe, (as <hi>Coppingers</hi> Bitch, that albeit ſhe could not turn the Hare, yet did her good will) ſo he was not wanting in doing his uttermoſt to promote that ſentence unto what it is, brought as many ſticks as he was able to bear unto that fire; and in the interim whiles this game was thus a playing, whereof you ſhall understand more in the ſequell of the Story: I had ſeverall other attempts made upon me to deſtroy me, and not by any men of mean and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rank and quality, but of the greateſt alwayes, and evermore and moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe of mine own profeſsion too, and yet by my own Countrymen more peculiarly amongſt the reſt, of which I could never yet apprehend any reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ſelf, but this, <hi>Obſequium amicos, veritas odium parit;</hi> for to my knowledge I never adminiſtred any juſt occaſion of exception to any man, if not <hi>occaſio accepta, non data;</hi> and as I have ſpent my years in trouble ever ſince I came into the world, ſo it hath gained me much experience I muſt confeſſe, and juſtly warned me to be ſtill upon my guard; but commonly he is accounted a peſtilent fellow, that lives out of the length of his enemies ſleeve, when 'tis but ſit for him not to truſt that will not be deceived: and who is it that deſires to live well, and will not comply with times, but he ſhall be ſubject unto much ſlander and reproach and oppoſition in the world, and then that ſide which is evermore the greateſt, that is commonly the worſt, will blemiſh his reputation, whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, who having thus gained an ill name, though but amongſt themſelves: it is like an ill face, which the broader it is drawn, and the more bright it hath about it, it appears the more deformed, as a little gold beaten into thin leaves, and a little water drawn into a thin ſteem and vapour, ſeemes wider then it was at firſt, ſo leſser Crimes, nay, ſome made ſo but in imagination, and fictious, being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed through the mouths of many, do quickly grow into a ſpreading cloud of infamy and diſgrace, and malevolent perſons do ſtill look upon mens actions with prejudice: and as <hi>Momus</hi> when he could not finde fault with the face in the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Venus,</hi> picked a quarrell at her ſlipper: ſo envious men will ever have ſomething to ſay either in the ſubſtance or circumſtance of our actions to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>report and expoſe to ſcandall, for ſpiders do convert to poyſon whatſoever they touch; and as a ſtone the higher the place is from whence it falls, it doth give the more dangerous blow, ſo the greater the perſonage is that acts for revenge, it is the more deadly and dangerous by much: there is no wound ſo mortall as that which is made with a thunder-bolt, ſo of all hatreds thoſe which makes pretences unto heaven, and which ariſe from Creatures of the higheſt nature, are evermore deſperate and mortall, and ſuch I have met withall, nor is it a wonder if enmity grows exceſsive, that hath zeal to kindle it, and pretence of Religion to warrant it, for when that which ſhould reſtrain, and ſet limits to a paſsion is made a party to mannage it, and fewell to foment it, we marvell not if a paſsion, which hath no bounds from Religion, do impoſe none upon it ſelf: they know the leſt

We reade of no good man but hath had his falls, hath been foiled, nay, beaten black and blue: for no man at all times can be wiſe, and no man liveth that ſinneth not: Thus the brighteſt glaſſe is ſtained with a little breath; and a little ſpot in a white paper is quickly made; and as men love me, ſo they will tell my tale; and though hear ſay hath no ſecurity of truth, yet most men are apt to believe the worſt, though of him they know not: a falſe report being as one Weed in a Noſegay, that overſmells all the Flowers: every man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to have that true he likes the beſt, and to which his fancie moves; which commonly is according to the firſt apprehenſion of things: and being once fixt in the underſtanding,<note place="margin">Iſa. 19.29, 20, 21.</note> it is very hardly removed from the judgement afterwards; an ill ſtomack being thus apt to nauſeate at the very beſt meat, that even wiſe men oft times do thus their buſineſſe unjuſtly, making a man an offender for a word, and turning aſide the juſt even for a thing of nought: It being the courſe of the children of this world to meaſure every mans Corn by their own Buſhel; to mete every mans Meaſure by their own Yard-wand: And becauſe their Candles ſhine upon their heads,<note place="margin">Job 29.6 Gen. 27.28.</note> and they waſh their ſteps with Butter, and the rock pours them out rivers of Oil, that they enjoy the fatneſſe of the earth, and plenty of Corn and Wine,<note place="margin">Pſa. 37.7</note> that their eyes ſtand out again, with that which the marrow of their bones encreaſeth;<note place="margin">Dan. 4.3.</note> being clothed with Honour and Majestie, as with a Garment, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Command of the People to obey them at every beck, enjoying indeed what their hearts can wiſh: Seeing the good men debarred of theſe pleaſures, for want of Spirituall eyes,<note place="margin">Mal. 3.15</note> they make them a Spectacle unto the World, to Angels, and to Men,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.9, 10, 11, 12.</note> reviling, perſecuting, and accounting them the filth of the world, and <hi>the off-ſcowring of all things unto this day:</hi> But theſe good Fortunes unto them are but as Quick-ſands to go upon, whereon if we ſtand, we ſink; and theſe men like Silk-worms, when they have wrought out their Silk, turn into Moths and Butter-flies: That as the Philoſopher, being demanded wherein the learned were more happie then the unlearned, anſwered onely, <hi>Spe,</hi> in Hope; ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes the Concluſion in this caſe, That <hi>if in this life onely the Saints had Hope,</hi>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169298:20"/>honourable Preſence here ſitting, were much abuſed and miſled to give their Judgements and Opinions to ſentence and condemn the ſaid <hi>John Yates</hi> for that Offence of threatning and terrifying of Witneſſes, and for the ſame to fine him the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> to pay to his Majeſties uſe 100 Marks, and to be committed to the priſon of the Fleet, and the Warden of the Fleet had thereupon taken him into his cuſtodie accordingly: But, upon the riſing of the Court, that day the Sollicitour of the ſaid Defendant <hi>Yates</hi> ſhewed to the Right honourable the Lord Keeper the Paper-copie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, which the ſaid Defendant had out of this Court, wherein the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were fair written, and ſtood in the ſaid Depoſition to the ſaid 39 Interrogatory without blotting, defacing or interlineation; whereby it plainly appeared to his Lordſhip, the ſaid Depoſition to be but upon hearſay: His Lordſhip thereupon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted all the honourable Preſence therewith in the inner-chamger, and, with all their Lordſhips conſents, reſpited the entrie of the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and ordered that the originall Depoſition ſhould be brought into the Court, the next ſitting-day to be peruſed, ſeen and viewed by all their Lordſhips, and thereupon to give their Order and Sentence; and in the mean time the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> was ſet at liberty, and diſcharged of his impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Whereupon, the Paper-copie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition being obtained by Maſter <hi>Jones,</hi> being Attorney for the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> in that Cauſe, from his the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk that carried his Books, was forthwith ſhewed by the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> to the Right honourable the Lord Keeper, and other the Lords then preſent, wherein the ſaid two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were defaced and blotted out of the ſaid <hi>John War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> Depoſition to the 39 Interrogatory; which had been openly read in Court, and miſled the Court to ſentence as aforeſaid, and by that means his Depoſition was made poſitive and abſolute, as of his own knowledge; whereas by the ſaid Defendants copie of the ſaid Depoſition, firſt ſhewed to his Lordſhip, with the words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) fair written therein, was upon hearſay. Shortly afterwards, <hi>viz.</hi> before two of the clock that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> came to <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inne, to the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his chamber there, and then and there, in preſence and hearing of Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> one other of the Attorneys of this honourable Court, in great perplexity, as it then ſeemed, fell into ſome paſſions, ſaying, <hi>What an infortunate man am I! What will become of me?</hi> And then being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> and Maſter <hi>Jones,</hi> Of whom he had or received his copies of the ſaid Depoſitions, (whereof that was one) anſwered, He could not tell whether he had received it from the Examiner or from <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nevile</hi> Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Clerk, with many bitter and heavie imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and oaths, vowing and proteſting, He knew not of the blotting out of thoſe words or altering the copie, and that the copies were as he firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them. Whereupon, the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> went all together into the Examiners Studie of this Court, to ſee the Record of the originall Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Warren</hi> to the ſaid 39 Interrogatory on his part; which being ſhewed unto him by the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner, the Record was fair and plain, with the words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, written, with the hand-writing of Maſter <hi>Gay</hi> the Examiner, who died in <hi>August</hi> laſt. Hereupon the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> uſed the like ſpeeches as before he had done in Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Studie, and ſo departed. Yet
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169298:20"/>afterwards the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> deſirous and plotting how to excuſe himſelf of defacing and blotting out of the ſaid two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) out of the copie of the ſaid Depoſition, and to lay and fix it upon the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevile,</hi> one of Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Clerks, on the morrow after, being the 26 day of <hi>October</hi> laſt, came into the Star-Chamber-Office in <hi>Grayes</hi>-Inne, and, before <hi>Matthew Goade</hi> Eſquire, Deputie-Clerk of this Court, being ſworn upon the holy Euangeliſts, did make a voluntary Oath and Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, That he, having retained Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> for his Attorney, and <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> his Clerk, to take care and ſollicite his ſaid Suit: and the Cauſe coming to publication, the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> undertook to procure for him, the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> the copies of the ſaid Depoſitions taken in that Cauſe, and for that purpoſe received not onely the Fees and Duties for ſuch copies as he procured for him the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> but likewiſe had extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſatisfaction for his pains therein; and that the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> went with him the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Examiners Office of the Court, and there procured other copies of Depoſitions belonging to this Cauſe, which were delivered to the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> in the preſence of the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> amongſt which was contained the Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Warren:</hi> That done, he repaired with the ſaid Books to Maſter <hi>Hudſon,</hi> being of his counſel, to be adviſed, and to peruſe the ſame Depoſitions: All which Depoſitions being peruſed accordingly, as well of the ſaid <hi>John Warren</hi> as the reſt, and his ſaid Counſel conceiving the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> to the 39 Interrogatory to be ſomething doubtfull, he made a mark in the Margent thereof, and wiſhed the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> for his better ſatisfaction, to go and get the ſame examined in the office, to ſee if the ſame Depoſition were truely copied; and that accordingly the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> repaired therewith to the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> and informed him what his Counſell had directed for examining the copie; and the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> took the ſaid Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> and carried it to the Examiners Office: but the Examiner not being within, the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> did leave the ſaid copie of the ſaid Depoſition with the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> to be examined, promiſing him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and content for his pains: and ſhortly after, the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> called to the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> for the ſame, who told him, That he had examined the ſaid <hi>Warrens</hi> Depoſition in that point with the Originall, and that he had then made it to agree with the Record, and ſo delivered the ſame back again to the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> with the two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) raſed in the ſaid <hi>Warrens</hi> Depoſition, as it now was in the ſaid copie; and after that, the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> gave him ſatisfaction for his pains and ſearch. And the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> depoſed and proteſted upon his Salvation, That the ſaid ſeverall words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were in the ſaid <hi>Warrens</hi> Depoſition fair writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, when he delivered the ſame to the ſaid <hi>Nevile;</hi> and that the ſaid words were raſed and blotted out, as they then were, when he received the ſame back again from the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> ſhewing the ſame to the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> and ſaid, That he had made it to agree with the Record. And the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> proteſted and affirmed, That the ſame was not altered or blotted out, either by him or any other to his knowledge, other then by the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> as aforeſaid. And the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> depoſed, That the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> was truſted with the charge and care of the ſaid Cauſe: and having taken upon him to draw the Bill, and part of the Interrogatory, and took upon him the ſolliciting and managing of the ſaid Cauſe, and over
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:169298:21"/>and beſides what he had received, he moved the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him further ſatisfaction after the hearing of the Cauſe. At which next ſitting, being the 27 of <hi>October</hi> laſt (according to the ſaid Order) was brought into this honourable Court the Record of the originall Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid <hi>John Warren,</hi> taken upon the ſaid 39 Interrogatory, and was ſeen, read and peruſed by this honourable Court, wherein the ſaid two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were fair written, without any blotting, defacing or interlineation; and thereupon the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> made humble ſuit to this honourable Court, that he might be ſworn in open Court, for the clearing of himſelf of any manner of ſuſpicion, or the leaſt touch that might have been imputed unto him thereabouts; who was ſworn accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and upon his Oath delivered, That, to his uttermoſt knowledge, he never ſaw the ſaid Paper-copie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was put into his hands to be read, at the hearing of the Cauſe the laſt Sitting before. Whereupon, all the honourable Preſence openly pronounced the ſaid Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> to be innocent and clear from the leaſt ſuſpicion of being privie or conſenting to the ſaid blotting or defacing of the ſaid copie. And the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> being then likewiſe preſent, humbly petitioned this honourable Court, that he himſelf, and the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> alſo, might be both ſworn upon their corporall Oaths in open Court, and examined upon Interrogatories or otherwiſe, touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing and blotting out of the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) and alſo that the ſaid Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> might be likewiſe ſworn to declare upon his oath what he could ſay, for diſcovery of the truth touching the matter aforeſaid: all which were ſworn in open Court accordingly. Whereupon, and upon publike reading of the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit in open Court, wherein and ſome Demands then made by the Court to the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> there plainly appeared a repugnancie to truth; wherein he had catched himſelf, and diſcovered his guiltineſſe of the ſaid Offence. The Court was pleaſed to required the Lord chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> both preſent in Court, to take the Examination of the ſaid <hi>Alexander Nevile</hi> and Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> touching the premiſes, who took great pains therein accordingly; and, by the earneſt ſollicitation of the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> on the ſeventh day of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> returned into this honourable Court their certificate of all their proceedings therein; which ſaid certificate was openly read in Court upon the tenth day of this inſtant <hi>November:</hi> upon the reading whereof, and opening the points of the ſame certificate by Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> Knight, of counſell with the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> the Court was inclineable to be of opinion, that the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf was the man that did blot out and deface the ſaid two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) out of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, for his own advantage againſt the ſaid late Defendant <hi>Yates:</hi> but for that the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> was neither himſelf in this honourable Court in perſon, neither had any counſel to ſpeak for him, the Court therefore did forbear to give any finall Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or Decree therein that day; but gave the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> time untill the next ſitting-day, to ſhew cauſe (if any he had) by his counſel or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why the Court ſhould not proceed to ſentence againſt him for that Miſdemeanour; or in default thereof, the Court intended to proceed to ſentence the next ſitting-day, at which time the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> was ordered to be preſent at the Bar in perſon. Now this day was read in open Court
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:169298:21"/>an Affidavit of <hi>Charles Bagſhaw</hi> Gentleman, That he had done his beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſerve the ſaid <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> with the ſaid Order, and to give him notice thereof; for which purpoſe, he had ſought him at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, and given unto his boy or Clerk (whom he found in his ſaid chamber) a true copie of the ſaid Order: and the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf offering to be depoſed, That he did, at the late Lord chief Juſtices, give the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf warning to attend the Court at his perill: All which notwithſtanding, the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> made default, and had withdrawn himſelf (as was now informed in this honourable Court.) Whereupon was read again, in open Court, the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit, and the ſaid Certificate of the ſaid Lord chief Juſtice and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge:</hi> Upon the reading whereof, and opening of all the parts and points thereof by Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> Knight, and Sir <hi>Heneage Finch</hi> Knight, Recordeer of <hi>London,</hi> both of counſel with the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> (who was preſent in Court himſelf, to ſtand to Juſtice) it plainly appeared to this moſt honourable Court, aſwell by divers apparant contrarieties between the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit aforementioned and his Examination taken upon his Oath before the ſaid Judges, as by divers other pregnant reaſons and circumſtances, conducing to prove him guilty of this great offence; and alſo by the teſtimony of <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <hi>EXCEPTIONS</hi> taken by the ſaid <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> Eſq; unto the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, Decree and Proceeding of the Court of Star-Chamber againſt him, touching the ſaid pretended blotting out of theſe two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) in the Paper-copie of one <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, taken in the Cauſe wherein he was Plaintiff in the ſaid Court againſt <hi>John Yates</hi> and others Defendants: <hi>In anno ſecundo</hi> Caroli <hi>Regis.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, againſt the Diſmiſsion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 THat it was given againſt him, notwithſtanding good cauſe and proof appearing within the Books to have ſentenced the Defendant <hi>Yates</hi> for that offence of terrifying of Witneſſes and tampering with them, albeit <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition to the nine and thirtieth Article had been wholly ſet aſide; and albeit <hi>John Warren,</hi> in his Depoſition to other Articles, proves in effect the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> guilty of the ſaid offence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That albeit <hi>Yates,</hi> upon the ſaid Hearing, was once fined for the ſaid Offence; yet he was afterwards diſmiſſed, when ſufficient matter thus appeared againſt him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That the Diſmiſſion was given, and coſts awarded againſt him, when he had proved ſome part of his complaint againſt ſome other of the Defendants beſides <hi>Yates,</hi> who dying before the hearing thereof, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a cenſure: for which cauſe (the act of God onely intervening) he ought to have had his coſts, and not paid coſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4 That this Diſmiſſion was given, when it appeared to the Court by ſo much of the cauſes as was already heard, that he had <hi>probabilem cauſam litigandi;</hi> and therefore if he ſhould have had no coſts, ought by the courſe of the Court to have paid no coſts.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That 130<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. Coſts was taxed by the late Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> then Lord Keeper, againſt him, whenas by the Bill of coſts it doth appear, that they are very immoderate and extreme:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, by the ſum and totall thereof, ſummoned up in the foot of the ſaid Bill of coſts, there appears to be 36<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. or thereabouts, caſt into the totall of the ſaid Bill, more then <hi>(re vera)</hi> the ſame do amount unto, by the particulars of the ſaid Bill; which muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be done, to give colour to tax and allow the more coſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Petitioner.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:169298:22"/>
            <p n="2">2 That there is 76<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. 10.4. ſet down for the Defendants travelling, charges, and ſometimes 8<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and 12<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and more in a Term, when in all that time, after the appearance and anſwers put in, their cauſe was commonly followed by their Agent and Attorney, who have their Fees allowed them in the Bill of coſts beſides.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That in the Bill of coſts 40<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. and more is ſet down at leaſt, for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-Fees in nine Terms, and ſometimes 12<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. in a Term; when, by the ordinary Rules of the Court, the Defendants ſhould have had allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but one counſel in every of theſe nine Terms, and but 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. a Fee in every Term; for, what is given more, is of the clients own ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, and not to have been charged upon him: So there is 116<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. 10<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. and more ſet down for travelling, charges and counſel-Fees.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, againſt the Sentence:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is illegal and without foundation, for the matter and manner of the ſaid Sentence: beſides, That the Paper-copie of that Depoſition in which the words are ſuppoſed to be blotted he could never ſee to this day, to be ſatisfied that it was ſo; it being taken from his ſervant in his abſence: nor had he peruſed it of neer three yeers before that time, but were with his Sollicitour attending for a hearing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, for the matter of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alleadged in the Sentence to be done by him for his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; which is not ſo:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe it appears he had no need to help the teſtimony of that Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by ſo indirect a courſe, becauſe it appears clearly in the Books, that there is ſufficient teſtimony beſides, for the proof of that Charge.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It cannot be preſumed that he, who had <hi>probabilem cauſam litigandi,</hi> and therefore by the courſe of that Court was to have paid coſts, albeit the Defendant had not been fined, would commit a Miſdemeanour which would not redound any thing to his benefit.</p>
            <p n="3">3 It cannot be preſumed that he would have done that act, which muſt of neceſſity have been controlled by the Defendants copie then preſent in Court, and by the Record it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4 It cannot be preſumed any ſuch act would have been done ſo groſly, a mark of eminence being made in the Margent, which would have made the thing the more remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> 1 Paper-copies of Depoſitions and Records are not credited till be juſtified for true copies upon Oath; which he never did do, as appears by the Sentence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 The common-Law (and that Court of Star-chamber imitating the Law in that) have never puniſhed offences of this nature with more then the loſſe of the fruit of that thing intended in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3 If Offences of this nature begin but by the tender of them to be read, it cannot be applied to him as an Offence; for <hi>Nevile</hi> his Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in the cauſe had the Books and managing of the cauſe at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and delivered them to Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Maſter, and Atturney in the cauſe, to read.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In all cauſes criminall, if the ſuppoſed Delinquent deny the fact, there ought to be no proceeding without Bill, or Information, Anſwer and Examination of Witneſſes, ſo that the party may make his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in this caſe: He did upon his Oath deny the fact objected, yet
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169298:23"/>the Court proceeded without Information, Bill, Anſwer or Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Witneſſes, whereby he loſt the be benefit of making his juſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, againſt the ground of the Sentence,</hi> viz. <hi>the proof of the fact objected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt, he did upon his Oath deny the fact, and there is no proof at all, either by confeſſion, depoſition or otherwiſe, to convince him.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That teſtimonie which is produced is then ſuch, upon whom the crime muſt have fallen in caſe he were not guilty, ſo that teſtimony onely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to purge ſuch as depoſed it, <hi>Nevil</hi> himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3 That M. <hi>Alexander,</hi> againſt all ordinary proceedings of Juſtice, after he had purged himſelf upon his Oath, was again enforced to be ſworn and reexamined upon his Oath, to have accuſed himſelf; and this his reex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination preſſed againſt him in the Sentence, againſt the truth thereof.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Matters extrajudicial and diverſe from the thing in queſtion, is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and depoſed againſt him, and inverted in the Sentence, contrary to all ordinary Rules of proceeding, and to the truth it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, againſt the ſentence it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 It is given againſt him without any legal notice, and in his abſence, neceſſitated upon reall occaſions, whereby he was diſabled to make his Defence.</p>
            <p n="2">2 It was interlaced with divers ſcandalous and impertinent ſuggeſtions, thereby to render him cauſleſly odious, and with ſome untrue ſurmiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> of proof of the crime, and of contradiction in his Examinations; neither of which are ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In caſe the Proceedings had been legal, and the Fact had been proved; yet the Sentence is exceſſive:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Exciſſive, in reſpect he had ſuffered before, <hi>viz.</hi> the reverſall of a Sentence pronounced for him, and taxing of 130 <hi>l.</hi> coſts to the Defendant.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Exceſſive in it ſelf, diſabling him to uſe his profeſſion, either publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the Bar, or privately in his chamber.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Fining him 500 <hi>l.</hi> to His Majeſtie.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In adjudging him to Impriſonment till he ſhould make a publike Submiſſion in Court, and confeſſe himſelf guilty of the Offence whereof he was innocent.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In inviting his expulſion out of the Society of <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was a Member; which thereupon was done, and his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeized and taken from him, for no other cauſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In giving 50 <hi>l.</hi> damages to <hi>Nevile,</hi> who was the wrong-doer, and guilty of the ſaid Offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, againſt the Proceedings after the Sentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1 That the Fine was paſſed under the Great Seal to one Maſter <hi>Humfrey Fulwood,</hi> then Maſter Secretary <hi>Cokes</hi> ſervant, and the greateſt part of it paid without ſuch Inſtalment as is uſually allowed of courſe in ſuch caſes,</p>
            <p n="2">2 That by means of the late Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> then Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> his great adveſary, and of the late Earl of <hi>Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> as ill affected to him; His Majeſties Grace and Favour for pardon, being then all the means left to give him being in the world, was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually interrupted and kept from him, that by many yeers ſollicitation
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:169298:23"/>of hisfriends in his abſence in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of many noble Perſonages at Court, it could not be obtained. And when at length his father in law, with much ado, prevailed with His Majeſtie for it; yet the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> ſo prevailed with His Majeſtie, that he cauſed a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be inſerted in it, That he ſhould not have liberty to uſe his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion here in this Kingdom, to put him out of all hopes of returning; well knowing that he was reſolved to queſtion his injuſtice, whereof there needed little other proof then the very Sentence it ſelf.</p>
            <div type="account">
               <head>Then, to make good theſe Exceptions, I ſhall take the Sentence aſunder and in Parts, and ſo proceed to ſhew the apparant Injuſtice done to Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> by it, and the Errours and Irregularity thereof.</head>
               <div type="part">
                  <q>1. <hi>THis day came to be heard, by ſpecial Order of this honourable Court of the</hi> 10 <hi>of this inſtant</hi> November, <hi>a very foul Offence, Practice and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of the</hi> Jerome Alexander <hi>an Utter-Barrester at the Law, and late Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff in this honourable Court againſt</hi> John Yates <hi>and others, late Defendants: which Cauſe was heard in open Court on the</hi> 25 <hi>of</hi> October <hi>last: At the hearing of which Cauſe, the main wherewith the ſaid</hi> Yates <hi>ſtood charged, was, The threatning and terrifying of Witneſſes which the ſaid</hi> Alexander <hi>was to produce ac a former Triall of</hi> Niſi Prius <hi>in the Countie of</hi> Norfolk, <hi>between him the ſaid</hi> Yates <hi>then Plaintiff, and the ſaid</hi> Alexander <hi>then Defendant.</hi> 
                     <bibl>Sentence fol.1.</bibl>
                  </q>
                  <p>In this firſt obſerve, The Sentence is given ſo ſoon as 'tis begun; and before any matter ſhown to prove the Fact, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced guilty of a foul Offence, Practice and Miſdemeanour; according to that Rule of <hi>Matchiavil,</hi> who adviſeth to caſt dirt enough in the face, and ſome will ſtick; to ſcandalize with many Reproaches, and the party, though never ſo innocent, ſhall not go away without ſome ſtain in his Reputation. Nor was the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> his threatning and terrifying of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes therein mentioned the main wherewith the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> ſtood charged in that Suit wherein Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was Plaintiff againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> and others Defendants, as the ſaid Sentence unjuſtly recites; but the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> in that Suit, was likewiſe charged with Subnornation of Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Imbracery as well with that Charge, and which ſtands proved againſt him in that Suit.</p>
                  <p>To make this appear, you ſhall underſtand, that in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term, 19 <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi,</hi> Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> preferred his Bill of Complaint in that Court of Star-Chamber againſt <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> Eſquire, for Perjury; <hi>John Yates,</hi> for ſubornation of Perjury, and for embracing of Jurors, and for tampering with and terrifying of Witneſſes; and againſt <hi>Allan Lampkin, William Wacy</hi> and <hi>John Lawrence,</hi> Jurors by <hi>Yates</hi> embraced.</p>
                  <p>The Bill ſets forth, that, About the the 30 of <hi>April, anno</hi> 14 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> father, then deceaſed, did, together with one <hi>Edward Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> and for his onely Debt, cauſe three Writings to be made, purporting Writings obligatory, with penalties of 10 <hi>l.</hi> apiece, mentioned to be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:169298:24"/>conditioned for the payment of 5 <hi>l.</hi> apiece to the ſaid <hi>John Yates</hi> at three ſeverall days: which being written, ſubſcribed and ſealed by the ſaid <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> and Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> father, were delivered into the hands of one <hi>Christopher Kirby,</hi> with him to remain as Eſcrolls, with this intent, That if the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> ſhould deliver up into the hands of the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi> one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the penalty of 40 <hi>l.</hi> conditioned for the payment of 24 <hi>l.</hi> wherein the ſaid <hi>Olifer</hi> ſtood bound unto the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> to be cancelled; that then the ſaid <hi>Christoper Kirby</hi> ſhould deliver the ſaid three Writings into the hands of the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> as the Acts and Deeds of the ſaid <hi>Olifer</hi> and of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> father; or otherwiſe not. And further ſet forth, that the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> did never deliver up the ſaid Bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> into the ſaid <hi>Kirby's</hi> hands to be cancelled, but refuſed ſo to do; and therefore the ſaid three Writings remained as Eſcrolls and void. That ſhortly after the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi> died; and after his deceaſe, and after ſuch time as the money was to have been paid, if the ſaid Writings had taken effect, the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> by ſome ſiniſter means, gains the ſaid three Writings into his hands, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſame in ſuit againſt Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> father, as if they had been his Deeds; who pleaed this eſpecial matter, and concluded <hi>non ſunt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta:</hi> Whereupon, iſſue was joyned; but before the Triall Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> father died, and made his ſaid ſon his ſole Executor, who proved the Will; and after, <hi>Yates</hi> commenced Suit againſt him as Executor to his father, upon the ſaid three Writings; to which Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> pleaded the ſame plea as his father had done before: And iſſue being joyned, the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had three ſeverall times taken out the Record of <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> and warned Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to a Triall, which he attended, to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme charge; but ſtill <hi>Yates</hi> durſt not trie it: Then Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> took forth the Record, to trie it by <hi>Proviſo;</hi> when the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had ſecretly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame Record out alſo: And now aſſuring himſelf that Maſter <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> would be ſecure, firſt, before the ſaid Aſſizes, the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> the more for to colour over the matter, laboured to have the differences put to arbitration: which being condeſcended unto, the Arbitratours met, and heard the differences; but did make no end: and preſently after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Yates</hi> endeavoured to have ſtollen a Triall of the ſaid Cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Witneſſes ſhould have come to Town, where the Aſſizes were kept; and the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> accordingly procured the ſame Cauſe to be called upon within an hour or two after Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> came to the Town, altogether unexpected to Maſter <hi>Alexander:</hi> and the Cauſe ſo coming to a Triall, and the Iſſue being, Whether the ſaid three Writings were delivered as the Deeds of the ſaid <hi>Olifer</hi> and Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> father abſolutely, or as Eſcrolls; Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> produced five ſeverall Witneſſes, thoſe whoſe names were ſubſcribed as Witneſſes to the ſaid Writings, as others alſo preſent at the making and delivery of them to <hi>Kirby;</hi> and one of them being a reverend Preacher and the maker of the Writings, and the reſt Gentlemen of good rank and quality; all which proved fully and clearly, that the ſame three Writings were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered as Eſcrolls, in ſuch manner as Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had pleaded: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which <hi>Yates</hi> did produce the ſaid <hi>Owen Godfrey,</hi> who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did depoſe and ſwear, that the ſame three Writings were delivered abſolutely, without any condition. And albeit it was further proved by Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> that the ſaid Maſter <hi>Godfrey</hi> was not preſent in the place
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:169298:24"/>when and where the ſame were ſo delivered as Eſcrolls, yet upon his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Teſtimony this <hi>Lampkin, Wacy</hi> and <hi>Lawrence,</hi> being ſworn upon the ſaid Jury, and friends to <hi>Yates,</hi> and by him embraced beforehand, did draw all the reſt of the Jurours to give a Verdict thereupon, for <hi>Yates,</hi> againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and againſt the truth: For which Perjury and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Embracery, and for <hi>Yates</hi> his tampering with and terrifying of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Witneſſes, to have made them ſilence the truth, were the Charges of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Bill, and cauſes of his Complaint.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term, 19 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> the Defendants anſwered.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Easter</hi>-Term, 20 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Publication paſſed.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 20 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> the Cauſe was ſet down for hearing.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-Term, 2 <hi>Caroli,</hi> the Cauſe came to be heard.</p>
                  <p>And thus it ſtood neer four yeers at hearing before it was heard; ſo hard a matter it was, in thoſe days, to procure a hearing in that Court.</p>
                  <p>Then, to prove this matter of the delivery of the three Writings in manner and form as Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath alleadged, and conſequently, the direct Perjury of the ſaid Maſter <hi>Owen Godfrey,</hi> ſee <hi>Robert Warren</hi> Clerk, <hi>li. A. fol.</hi> 23. to the 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15 Interrogatories, who proveth it in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>That he was at the Priſon kept by <hi>Christopher Kirby</hi> in <hi>Fakenham,</hi> upon the 30 of <hi>April,</hi> in the 14 yeer of His Majeſties Reign (which was the 14 yeer of the Reign of King <hi>James</hi>) the Depoſitions being taken in his Reign) this Deponent being then in Durance in the ſaid Priſon) in the morning of which day the ſaid <hi>Christopher Kirby</hi> came to him this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent into the chamber where this Deponent lodged, and gave him this Deponent Inſtructions to make and write four Writings, in three whereof the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer</hi> and one <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> father unto the now Complainant, were to ſtand bound unto the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> in the penalty of ten pounds apiece, for the payment of five pounds apiece, at three ſeverall days in the Conditions of the ſaid Bonds of Writings ſpecified, and the fourth of the ſaid Writings to be entred into by the ſaid <hi>Olifer</hi> alone, in the like penalty of ten pounds, for the payment of five pounds to the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> at a certain day mentioned in the Condition of the ſame. And when he the ſaid <hi>Christopher Kirby</hi> had given him this Deponent Inſtructions for the making of the ſaid Bonds, he willed him to make preſent diſpatch of the writing of them, ſo that, as he ſaid, the Complainants father was to come that afternoon to ſeal unto the ſame. And ſaith, that when he this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent had made an end of writing the ſaid Writings obligatory, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſaid Complainants father was come into the houſe, he this Deponent brought them down and delivered them to the ſaid <hi>Kirby,</hi> whom this Deponent found in the Celler of the ſaid houſe, where the Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants ſaid father, and the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer,</hi> and one <hi>Robert Dye, Peter Browne</hi> and ſome others were. And he ſaith, that the ſaid Complainants father having peruſed three of the ſaid Writings wherein himſelf and the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer</hi> were to be bound, he the Complainants ſaid father and the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer</hi> did ſeal the ſame: and whiles they were enſealing, it being reported that the ſaid Defendant <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> was come into the ſaid houſe, and was gone into the Parlour, the ſaid Maſter <hi>Kirby</hi> made haſte to go up to him; and being upon the Stayers, the ſaid <hi>Jerome Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Complainants father called to him and requeſted him to ſtay,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169298:25"/>ſaying, They would make an end ere they left: and thereupon the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi> came two or three ſteps down the Stayers; and ſtaying there, the Complainants father and the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer</hi> delivered the ſaid Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the Complainants ſaid father uſing theſe words; <hi>Master</hi> Kirby, <hi>we deliver you theſe Writings to remain in your hands as Eſcrolls, upon condition, That if</hi> Yates <hi>ſhall deliver into your hands a Bond wherein</hi> Edward Olifer <hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth bound to him in</hi> 40 l. <hi>to be cancelled; then theſe Writings ſhall be our Deeds, otherwiſe not.</hi> With which manner of delivery the ſaid <hi>Chriſtoper Kirby</hi> found fault, and, uſing to call the ſaid <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> Maſter, ſaid, <hi>Maſter, I like not theſe conditionall-Deliveries; I pray let me have it otherwiſe.</hi> And the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> replied, <hi>Chooſe whether you will have them or no, I will deliver them no otherwiſe; for unleſſe</hi> Yates <hi>deliver you the old Bond firſt, he ſhall have none of my Bonds;</hi> (or words to that effect) <hi>therefore I charge you that you keep theſe Writings in your hands untill that Bond be firſt delivered:</hi> with ſome other words of committing a truſt to him in that behalf. Which being done, and the ſaid <hi>Christopher Kirby</hi> haſting to ſee the ſaid <hi>Owen God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> he carried the ſaid three Writings in his hands up the ſaid Celler-ſtayers, and thorow an Entry, and ſo up to the upper end of the Hall in the ſaid houſe, neer towards the Parlour, he there delivered the ſaid Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to him this Deponent, and requeſted him to ſet his hand to every of them as a Witneſſe, ſaying, that the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby</hi> ſhould ſet to his hand afterwards well enough. And this Deponent further ſaith, That in the afternoon of the ſame day, after they had dined in the Parlour, he this Deponent brought down the ſaid Writings, with this Deponents name ſubſcribed thereunto as a Witneſſe: and delivering them again to the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby,</hi> being then in the ſaid Parlour with the ſaid <hi>Owen Godfrey,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> the Complainants father, and one <hi>Matthew Lancaster, John Allen, Edward Olifer</hi> and ſome others: and this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent laying the ſaid Writings before him the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he would have ſubſcribed his name unto them, the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby</hi> firſt ſpake to the ſaid <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> then ſitting at the Table, and the Complainants ſaid father on the bench by him; and having uſed to call the Complainants ſaid father ſometimes <hi>Noble Maſter,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull friend,</hi> ſpake to him by one of theſe terms, but which of them this Deponent now certainly remembreth not, and ſaid, <hi>I would you would give us your hand to theſe Bonds,</hi> beginning to make relation of the buſineſſe in ſome other manner and terms then the delivery of the ſaid Writings was done and performed, in ſpeaking to this effect, That the Complainants father and the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifer</hi> had delivered them into his the ſaid <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Kirby's</hi> hands, to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>John Yates.</hi> At which words, the ſaid Complainants father ſtepped up, and, ſeeming angry, ſaid, <hi>How? we have delivered them as Eſcrolls: if the ſaid</hi> Yates <hi>ſhall deliver you</hi> Edward Olifers <hi>oldBond to be cancelled, that then they ſhall be our Deeds, otherwiſe not.</hi> And other ſealing and delivery of the ſaid Bonds or Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings this Depondent ſaw not at that time, but nnely a Repetition of what was done before, in manner as aforeſaid. And this Deponent ſaith, That after ſuch Repetition was made, the ſaid Defendant <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> did, at the requeſt of the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby,</hi> ſet his hand to the ſaid Writings; and when he had done, the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> did then ſet his name unto them, and took them preſently and locked them up in his Desk, which ſtood neer
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169298:25"/>the lower end of the Table in the ſaid Parlour. And more he cannot, to his now-remembrance, certainly depoſe the ſaid Interrogatories; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> was not in the Celler of the ſaid houſe, where the ſaid Writings were ſealed and delivered, at the time of the ſealing and delivery of the ſame; but was ſaid to be then in the Parlour of the ſaid houſe, which is three rooms diſtant from the ſaid Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. And ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby</hi> did keep the ſaid three Writings in his hands after the ſaid 30 day of <hi>April,</hi> in the ſaid 14 yeer of His Majeſties Reign, untill the time of his death; and he died on the 25 day of <hi>March,</hi> in the yeer of our Lord God 1617. And ſaith, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi>'s death, all the days of payment limited in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſaid Writings were paſt. And this Deponent ſaith, That the cauſe which moved the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby</hi> to detain and keep the ſaid Writings from the ſaid Defendant <hi>Yates,</hi> was, for that the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> refuſed to deliver in the old Bond of the ſaid <hi>Edward Olifers</hi> to be cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as this Deponent verily believeth: and this Deponent is rather indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe the ſame, for that the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Kirby,</hi> uſing many times to ride to <hi>Walſingham</hi>-Market and <hi>Burnham</hi>-Market, where he may times met with the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> did, at his coming home, tell this Deponent and others, That he had made the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> and others acquainted with his the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi>'s having the ſaid three Writings obligatory aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and had offered to deliver them unto him, ſo he would deliver him up the ſaid old Bond of <hi>Edward Olifers</hi> to be cancelled; but he ſaid, That the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> did always refuſe to deliver up the ſaid old Bond, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, That he the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> ſhould never have the ſaid three Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; or to that effect. And beſides, this Deponent being in company with the ſaid Defendant <hi>Yates,</hi> after the death of the ſaid <hi>Kirby,</hi> and after the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had got the Writings into his hands and put them in Suit, this Depondent told him, that ſure it was his the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> his fault that the moneys payable upon the ſaid Writings were not paid unto him at the times limited in the Conditions of them, for that the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to deliver up the ſaid old Bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> then affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him this Deponent, that indeed he had refuſed to deliver up the ſaid old Bond, for that the ſaid <hi>Kirby</hi> had not followed ſuch directions as he gave him in taking ſecurity for his money due upon the ſaid Bond of 40 <hi>l.</hi> or words to that effect. And this Deponent well remembreth, that he this Deponent was called by ſummons, with other Witneſſes, on the Complainants behalf, to be at three ſeverall Aſſizes, two at <hi>Norwich,</hi> and one at <hi>Thetford</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to have teſtified in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants behalf concerning the ſaid Writings, which tended to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants ſaid great trouble and expences. And ſaith, That he this Deponent was produced and ſworn as a Witneſſe in the foreſaid Cauſe between the ſaid Defendant <hi>Yates</hi> and the now-Complainant, at the laſt Aſſizes holden at <hi>Thetford,</hi> in and for the Countie of <hi>Norfolk.</hi> And ſaith, That he this Deponent was ſerved with Proceſſe to be at the ſaid Aſſizes, and to teſtifie on the part of the now-Complainant; and there teſtified the truth of his knowledge and remembrance, giving ſuch evidence, or to the ſame effect, as is mentioned and ſet down in this Deponents Anſwer and Depoſition to the fifth, ſixth and ſeventh Interrogatory. And ſaith, That the ſaid <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> was, at the ſaid laſt Aſſizes holden at <hi>Thetford,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:169298:26"/>produced as a Witneſſe againſt the now-Complainant, by the ſaid Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>John Yates,</hi> in the ſaid Cauſe concerning the ſaid three Writings; and the evidence which he then and there gave to the ſaid Jury upon his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall-Oath concerning the ſaid Cauſe, was, That the ſaid <hi>Olifer</hi> and the now-Complainants father did ſeal and deliver the ſaid three Writings as their Deeds abſolutely, to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>John Yates,</hi> without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at all, <hi>&amp;c</hi> And ſaith, That ſome time before the ſaid laſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes holden at <hi>Thetford,</hi> the now-Complainant ſpake unto this Deponent, and told him, That he had brought down the Triall between <hi>Yates</hi> and him by Proviſo, and would be no longer dallied with by the ſaid <hi>Yates:</hi> and withall the ſaid Complainant delivered him this Deponent a <hi>Subpena</hi> to be at the ſaid Aſſizes: the ſaid Complainant told him this Deponent, that the matter between him and the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> was put to the Arbitrement of <hi>John Marcoll</hi> and <hi>John Coot,</hi> and therefore prayed him this Deponent to be at <hi>Walſingham</hi> on the Saturday immediately before the ſaid Aſſizes, where the ſaid Arbitratours had a Meeting, whereat this Deponent was preſent; but no end could be there made. And he ſaith, that at the ſaid Meeting the now-Complainant demanded of the ſaid <hi>John Yates,</hi> Why he (being the Complainant) did not bring down the ſaid Triall, but put him the ſaid Complainant to bring it down by Proviſo. And the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thereunto (as this Deponent now remembreth) was to this effect; Becauſe he the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> would not be ſo troubleſome to the Countrey, for that <hi>Thetford</hi> was a place where people could get no good diet nor lodging; or to that effect. And ſaith, That on Munday, being the firſt day of the ſaid Aſſizes, between twelve and one of the clock the ſame day, he this Deponent and the now-Complainant came thither; the Complainant not thinking but that he might have had the Cauſe called upon when he would, in regard he had brought it down by Proviſo: but when he came, he was told, that the ſame Cauſe had been called upon to be tried the firſt or ſecond Cauſe; the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> having ſecretly brought the ſame down alſo, without the now-Complainants privity: But the Complainant was then told, that a friend of his had cauſed the ſaid Cauſe to be put off till the afternoon the ſame day, in regard the ſaid now-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant was not come with his Witneſſes when the ſame was firſt called on, and ſo the ſame Cauſe was called on again in the afternoon the ſame day, and then it was tried, before the now-Complainant was full ready with his Witneſſes.</p>

The ſaid Maſter <hi>Godfrey</hi> anſwered this Deponent upon his ſpeech with him, That he could not come, and that he could do the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> no good in the ſaid triall, becauſe it was ſo long ſince the ſaid Bonds were delivered, that he did not remember how they were delivered.</p>
                  <p>And yet afterwards he was procured to come, and to depoſe falſly, which muſt be by ſome ſtronger perſwaſion and means uſed by <hi>Yates</hi> then before.

                  <p>Saith, That on the Saturday next before the Aſſizes (being the Aſſizes in which the ſaid cauſe was tried) one <hi>Allan Lampkin,</hi> who was one of the Jury ſummoned to appear at the ſaid Aſſizes, for triall of the Iſſue then to be tried between the now-Complainant, then Defendant, and the now-Defendant <hi>Yates,</hi> then Complainant, came to the Deponent, who was likewiſe returned of the ſaid Jury, and did ask when he meant to go to the ſaid Aſſizes: and this Deponent anſwered him, That he meant to go next morning; ſaying, That if he were there any time before noon, it would be time enough. Whereto the ſaid <hi>Lampkin</hi> replied, That he would ride away to <hi>Thetford</hi> that night, and wiſhed this Deponent to ride with him, ſaying, That the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had brought down the Writ of <hi>Niſi Prius,</hi> as well as the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> and that he would have the matter tried at the firſt ſitting, if he could, in the morning, if he could; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all intreating this Deponent that he would ſay nothing thereof to the ſaid <hi>Alexander,</hi> for that <hi>Yates</hi> would not that he ſhould know thereof by any means. To 22 ſaith, That after the Evidence given to the Jury at the ſaid Aſſizes at <hi>Thetford</hi> between the now-Complainant and the now-De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant <hi>Yates,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Allan Lampkin</hi> being one of the ſaid Jury, did, ſo ſoon as the Jury were gone together to conſider of their Evidence, uſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169298:27"/>theſe ſpeeches, <hi>(viz.) Maſters, we muſt finde for the Complainant,</hi> (meaning the now-Defendant <hi>Yates,</hi> who was Plaintiff in the ſaid Action) <hi>and therefore do what you will, I believe none but Maſter</hi> Godfreys <hi>Teſtimony; and here will I lie, if ye finde not for</hi> Yates. And thus <hi>Wacy</hi> and <hi>Lawrance</hi> his companions, out of ſpleen to the ſai Complainant, would be of the ſame mindes; and theſe drew the reſt of the Jury to give a Verdict in that cauſe for <hi>Yates,</hi> againſt the truth. Others alſo teſtifie the ſame carriage by theſe Jurours.</p>
                  <p>Upon all which matter it doth appear, that <hi>Yates</hi> his terrifying of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were not the main charges of the Bill, as the Sentence relates.

                  <p>But Maſter <hi>Owen Godfrey</hi> the Perjurour died before the hearing of the cauſe, and therefore the ſuborner <hi>Yates</hi> could not be fined for the Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet by this it doth appear, that the ſaid Complainant had more then <hi>probabilem cauſam litigandi,</hi> and therefore ought to have paid no coſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Who depoſeth, That he being in the <hi>Faulcon</hi>-yard, an Inne in little-<hi>Walſingham,</hi> and ſeeing the Defendant <hi>Yates</hi> there, went to him, to ſpeak with him about fourty ſhillings that was remaining due from this Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent unto the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> of a debt of 14 <hi>l.</hi> or thereabouts, for which the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> had had a Judgement againſt this Deponent, and all thereof ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied but the ſaid 40 <hi>s.</hi> for the payment whereof, this Deponent entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> to ſpare him this Deponent for ſome ſhort time: and then the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> did requeſt and importune him this Deponent to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his this Deponents brother, <hi>Robert Warren,</hi> to be ſparing in giving his evidence againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> at the Aſſizes then following, in the Cauſe between him the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> and the ſaid Complainant: And if this Deponent would ſo do, the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> promiſed him this Deponent, that he would deal well with him for the aforeſaid Debt due unto him, and would do this Deponent a greater courteſie. And this Deponent ſaith, That ſince that time, the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> meeting with him this Deponent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:169298:28"/>in <hi>Walſingham</hi>-Market, told him, That he had been untowardly paid the debt which this Deponent owed him: And ſaid withall, That he did hear that this Deponent ſhould have gone to <hi>London</hi> the Term before, to have been a Witneſſe againſt him the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> in the Cauſe between him and the Complainant: but if this Deponent had gone, he ſaith he would preſently have remembred him this Deponent therein. This Deponent thinketh his meaning was, He would have renewed his Execution againſt him this Deponent. And this Deponent further ſaith, That one <hi>Luke Banks</hi> Clerk, underſtanding that he this Deponent ſhould have gone for <hi>London</hi> the laſt Term, to have been a Witneſſe for the Complainant, did wiſh him this Deponent not to ſtir his foot thereabouts, alleadging many dangers might enſue upon it: Whereupon, this Deponent did not go to <hi>London</hi> that Term to be a Witneſſe for the Complainant, although he this Deponent was lawfully called by the Complainant thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Whereby it further appears, That albeit the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the 39 Article had not been made uſe of at the hearing, yet to this 46 Article he teſtifies as much as proved <hi>Yates</hi> guilty of terrifying and tampering with Witneſſes to conceal the truth: And ſo three Witneſſes clearly concurring in the point of this Charge againſt <hi>Yates,</hi> without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; which the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry, ex Officio,</hi> and according to the duty of his place, ought to have cauſed the Kings Coucell to have peruſed and looked into the proceedings, to ſee if there had been matter and proof ſufficient within the Books, to have continued the Fine ſet upon <hi>Yates</hi> for the King, notwithſtanding any other miſcarriage in the buſineſſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if there had been any: Which he was ſo far from looking after, as it was his onely ſtrife and labour which way and how to faſten this miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Neviles</hi> upon Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and thought upon nothing elſe: which endeavours to ruine him had another Riſe, if it were pertinent to this purpoſe to be here inſerted.</p>
                  <p>And from all this that hath been ſaid, it will not be denied, but that, if <hi>Yates</hi> had been diſmiſſed, (as he ought not to have been, without cenſure) yet then Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was to have paid no coſts.</p>
                  <p>This then is the firſt Complaint of Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> againſt the Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Yates,</hi> That <hi>Yates</hi> was diſmiſſed againſt pregnant proof, and ſuch as ſatisfied the Court of <hi>Yates</hi> his guiltineſſe of terrifying of Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> Witneſſes, if it might have been received; and was deſired and preſſed by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to have been taken into conſideration, after this queſtion did ariſe; which the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> ſlightly paſſed over without regard, and ſo awed Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> and his counſel, that they, perceiving what he went about, and the Officers of the Court labouring by all means poſſible to take off the offence from one of their Members the ſaid <hi>Nevile,</hi> and it being the Court whereunto his counſell applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for practice, not one of them would be feed to ſpeak a word: and whatſoever Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> preſſed in his own defence, was miſinterpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and an ill ſenſe endeavoured to have been put upon, it and upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſpake for maintenance of the Cauſe and clearing of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
                  <p>The next Exception taken by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Diſmiſſion, is this, That 136 <hi>l.</hi> coſts was taxed againſt him, to be paid unto the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:169298:28"/>upon that diſmiſſion, by the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> whereas no coſts were awarded againſt him by the Order of the Court; and whereas by the courſe of the Court, he rather was to have had coſts, then to have paid any coſts: For which obſerve the Bill of Coſts it ſelf; and firſt its title.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this Bill of Coſts Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath theſe juſt Exceptions:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he leaveth it to judgement, if the Defendants Attorney in that Suit, who drew it up and preſented it, did give a clear and fair title to this Bill of coſts or not: for, by the Teſtimony and Evidence aforeſaid, it appears, that the Complaint was neither wrongfull, unjuſt, vexatious, malicious or ſlanderous, the Perjury, Subornation, imbracery and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and terrifying of Witneſſes being ſo fully and clearly proved as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it appeareth, that in the Bill of coſts he ſetteth down in the foot the totall thereof to amount unto 191 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> whereas, <hi>re vera,</hi> and in truth, the ſum is but 162 <hi>l.</hi> 17 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> being rightly caſt; ſo that he ſets down 36 <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>s.</hi> more in his totall, then is contained in his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: And this, I may be bold to ſay, was not well done, nor according to his duty; for by this means the greater coſts were allowed unto the Defendants.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this all the injury done to Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> by this Bill of coſts; for there are many unwarrantable particulars therein alſo inſerted, no ways to have been demanded or allowed: for there is ſet down of this for the Defendants very travelling-charges and expences, 76 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and of his, 3 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>l.</hi> 11 <hi>l.</hi> and 16 <hi>l.</hi> ſet down ſpent in a Term; when, after the firſt Temr of their appearance and putting in of their Anſwers in Court, their defence was made by a Sollicitour, who, at moſt, had not above 10 <hi>s.</hi> a Term for his pains: Beſides, they were Yeomen, and not of any quality, that they ſhould be ſo laviſh in their expences.</p>
                  <p>Nor is this all; for in this Bill of coſts there is alſo ſet down for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel-Fees and their Clerks Fees 46 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> or thereabouts, and 4 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>l.</hi> ſet down for counſel-Fees in a Term, when nothing is ſaid to be done but peruſing of Books and attending at the Bar; whereas, according to the nſuall courſe of all Courts, the Client, Plaintiff or Defendant recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:169298:31"/>or being diſmiſſed upon his Bill of coſts, is but to inſert, and ought not o be allowed more than 10 <hi>s.</hi> for a Counſellours Fee, and but for one counſel in a Term; if he retains more, or rewards them better, it is of his own ſuperfluity, and for his own diſpatch: and all this 130 <hi>l.</hi> was demanded, upon the matter, but for nine Terms proceedings, For though it be true, that the Cauſe depended 24 Terms; yet in 15 of thoſe Terms nothing was done wherein counſel was uſed, as it doth appear by the Bill of coſts it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The Attorneys of this Court, when they did enter into their Offices, did take a ſolemn Oath to behave themſelves juſtly towards His Majeſtie and all His loving ſubjects: and that it was one part of their duties in their places, to have drawn up Bills of coſts for their Clients after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Diſmiſſions, wherein they ought not to have exceeded their bounds and moderation, without the ſubjecting themſelves to the danger of cenſure: ſo when theſe Miniſters of the Court did tranſgreſſe, and go beyond their rules and limits, it was no warrant to the ſaid Lord Keeper, in whom the overſight and controll thereof did onely lie, thereupon to do injury to any other: Through neſcience it could not be, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed done by negligence, eſpecially being at the firſt entrance into his place; for ſome other reaſon then it was, which I muſt leave you to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Moreover, it was the courſe of that Court, in all caſes, that where the Defendants, or any of them, were proved guilty of the crimes and offences charged in the Bill, albeit, in reſpect of ſome intervenient acts, it ſo fell out, as that they could not be ſentenced (the ſame not being an act of the Complainants own wrong) in ſuch cauſes; albeit the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were freed from cenſure, yet did they uſually pay the Plaintiffs their coſts; as in the caſe of one <hi>Tunſtall,</hi> and of one <hi>Allen,</hi> in that Court, a citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who had a Bond from the friends of one of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices in 40 <hi>l.</hi> conditioned for his ſaid Apprentices truth, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full carriage of himſelf in his Maſters ſervice; and this 40 <hi>l.</hi> was placed in the Bond in figures: And the Apprentice imbezzelling more from his Maſter then the Penalty would ſatisfie, he added a cypher and made it 400 <hi>l.</hi> and upon that brought his Action; for which, a Bill of Forgery was preferred againſt him in the Star-chamber: and upon a ſolemn debate and hearing of the cauſe, albeit it was adjudged to be no forgery, but did onely make void the Obligation, and ſo left him remedileſſe to recover any thing upon than Bond, and therefore the cauſe diſmiſſed; yet the truth and allegation of the Plaintiffs Bill apearing to be proved to the Court, he was adjudged to pay the Plaintiff his coſts: And ſo in many other caſes of like nature it hath been done in that Court.</p>
                  <p>And whether Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> caſe be not much better proved againſt the Defendants in his Suit of crimes cenſurable, the act of God onely preventing the puniſhment of the Perjurour, and thereupon the Suborner onely cleared of that charge, and the other charges of the Bill againſt the other Defendants, confeſſed in the Sentence to be proved by ſingle Teſtimony: And it appearing, that there was ſufficient matter in the Books fully to have convicted the Defendants guilty of the crimes laid unto their charge, and was not Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> fault that they were not heard. Thus far he leaveth it to be rightly conſidered how he was dealt withall in this Diſmiſſion with coſts.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:169298:32"/>
                  <p>Beſides, as the caſe ſtood, he conceiveth the matter extraordinary, it was not in the power of the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> as upon ordinary diſmiſſions, and matters of form, to have taxed any coſts, without an eſpecial Order af the Court, for which he had none.</p>
                  <p>And when you ſhall peruſe the Order of Diſmiſſion, which followeth, and which was all the Ground and Warrant for taxing of this Bill of Coſts; if you ſhall be but pleaſed to remember what hath been proved before, you will underſtand it to be the forerunner of the reſolved ruine intended towards Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in that matter, ſtufft with apparant untruths, and making way for that which after followed. The Order followeth.</p>

                           <p>THis day came to be heard the matter of Complaint here exhibited by <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> Eſq; Plaintiff againſt <hi>John Yates, John Lawrence, Allan Lampkin</hi> and <hi>William Wacy</hi> Defendants, for ſuppoſed Perjury, Subornation of Perjury, Inbracery of Jurours, and threatning and terrifying of Witneſſes; which by the Plaintiffs Bill was laid to the charge of the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> onely: Upon the opening whereof, by the Plaintiffs Counſel at the Bar, and reading the proofs on his part, there appeared no ſufficient matter at all to convince the ſaid Defendants <hi>Lawrence, Lampkin</hi> and <hi>Wacy,</hi> or any of them, of the ſaid ſuppoſed offences or miſdemeanours wherewith they, every or any of them, ſtood charged by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Bill, and therefore the Court hath abſolutely diſmiſſed and diſcharged them and every of them, of and from any further attendance about the ſame Cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. But as touching the ſaid <hi>John Yates,</hi> for the ſaid offences of threatning of Witneſſes, there were read, for proof thereof, two Witneſſes, viz. <hi>Robert Warren</hi> Clerk, and <hi>John Warren,</hi> on the Plaintiffs part: in the Depoſition of which ſaid <hi>John Warren,</hi> taken in Court ot the nine and thirtieth Interrogatory, as the Plaintiffs copie thereof read in Courts was, the words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were blotted out and defaced, and by that means the ſaid Depoſition was poſitive and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, as upon the Deponents own knowledge: whereas the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) being not blotted out, is but upon hearſay. Which blotting out and defacing of the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) in two ſeverall places of the ſaid <hi>John War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens</hi> Depoſition to the ſaid <hi>39</hi> Interrogatory, much miſled the judgement and cenſure of his Honourable Court, who condemned the ſaid <hi>John Yates</hi> for that offence, and adjudged him to pay one hundred Marks Fine to His Majeſties uſe, and to be committed to the priſon of the Fleet. But in the Defendants copie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition to the <hi>39</hi> Interrogatory, the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were fair written, without any blotting, defacing or interlining: Which ſaid Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Warren</hi> to the ſaid <hi>39</hi> Interrogatory being ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Honourable Court upon the riſing thereof, it pleaſed the ſame Court to take it into conſideration, and ordered that the originall Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Warren</hi> to the ſaid <hi>39</hi> Interrogatory, on the Plaintiffs part, ſhould be brought into this Court the next ſitting-day, to be ſeen and viewed by their Lordſhips; and if the ſaid words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were in the ſaid originall Depoſition fair writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, without blotting, defacing or interlineation, then this honourable Court would be pleaſed to diſmiſſe the ſaid Defendant <hi>yates,</hi> and to diſcharge him likewiſe of any further attendance about the ſame Cauſe hereafter: in the mean time the Court diſcharged the ſaid <hi>John Yates</hi> out of the Custody of the Warden of the Fleet, for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169298:32"/>and upon that Sentence; at which next ſitting-day <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>27</hi> day of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <hi>October,</hi> the original Depoſition of the ſaid <hi>John Warren,</hi> taken on the Plaintiffs behalf, upon the ſaid <hi>39</hi> Interrogatory, was brought into this Honourable Court accordingly; and the ſame being ſeen, peruſed and viewed by this Honourable court, the ſever all words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) plainly appeared in the ſaid originall Depoſition to be fair written by the Examiner himſelf, without any blotting, defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing or interlining; and ſo the ſaid Depoſition was upon hearſay, and not of the Deponent <hi>John Warrens</hi> own knowledge: This Honourable Court, therefore, conceiving they had no ſufficient ground for the former Sentence, have thereupon ordered, adjudged and decreed, That the ſaid former Sentence against the ſaid <hi>John Yates</hi> ſhall not be entred, but that he ſhall likewiſe be abſolutely diſmiſſed and diſcharged of and from any further attendance about the ſame Cauſe hereafter.</p>

                  <p>But he thought a worm ſoon cruſhed under foot: and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> being then but new entred into the world, and daring to queſtion ſuch a man as Maſter <hi>Godfrey,</hi> ſon and heir to <hi>Richard Godfrey,</hi> that famous Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in his time, of <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, but a Popiſh Recuſant; and his ſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allied and befriended in that Countrey where your Petitioner dwelt, to all the great ones, it is no hard matter for any man to believe; and for that reaſon to conceive, that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> could not want adverſaries. Beſides, it was a fault in thoſe times to be too forward, though in zeal to juſtice, and for the good of the Common-wealth, if ſuch a man were toucht upon: and when ſuch as Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> that would not comply with the times, twas high time to take occaſion to rid them out of the way. But obſerve this untruth alleadged in the Order. To begin withall, it ſaith, The words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were blotted out in two places of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, which they alleadge not in their whole proccedings, either before or after.

                  <q>3. <hi>But upon the riſing of the Court that day, the Sollicitour of the ſaid Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> Yates (which was M. <hi>Fountain</hi> the Lawyer, now with the King, and which made him be preſently called to the Bar, and thereupon made my Lord Keeper <hi>Coventries</hi> favourite ever afterwards) <hi>ſhewed to the Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour able the ſaid Lord Keeper the Paper-copie of the ſaid</hi> John Warrens <hi>Depoſition, which the ſaid Defendant had out of this Court, wherein the ſaid words</hi> (that <hi>and</hi> did) <hi>were fair written, and ſtood in the ſaid Depoſition to the</hi> 39 <hi>Interrogatory, without blotting, defacing or inter lineation; wherewith it plainly appeared to his Lordſhip, the ſaid Depoſition to be but upon hearſay,</hi> 
                     <bibl>Sent. fol. 2.</bibl>
                  </q>
                  <p>This needs little other Anſwer then what hath preceded, That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſumed that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> would do ſuch an act, which both the Paper-copies of the Defendants Depoſitions and the Record it ſelf muſt infallibly have controlled in Court, as it did: Beſides, it had been a ſottiſhneſſe and ſtupidity in Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to have done this act, which, for the reaſons aforeſaid, could in no meaſure have turned to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: which being carried along to the end of the Caſe, will make it <hi>luce elarior,</hi> it was na opportunity purpoſely taken to deſtroy him, for which there had been many attempts made and plots laid before; and the good God, that hath been evermore his Deliverer, delivered him out of thoſe alſo, though evermore upon the pits brink, that he might look up to his Defender, and foreſee the like dangers and avoid them; which, as this caſe was, was not poſſible for him to do: but, by that which followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it proved a greater mercy, though intended to him for a miſery and his deſtruction; which is neither proper for, and would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is not denied but that a mark weas made in the margent of that Paper-copie, like an hand or finger, pointing to the words, intimating ſomething to be done concerning them; which no man, in his wits, would have made in that place, if he had intrended to have made uſe of it for an advantage by obſcuring it at the hearing.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> well underſtood the courſe of that Court, and of all Courts of Juſtice, that the ſaid Depoſition muſt be publikely read in the face and view of all the Officers of the Court, and therefore not poſſible to be concealed from diſcovery: And the practice of that Court and of all Courts of equity is, that both parties having like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the ſame Depoſitions, it is the conſtant practice of the Attorneys of both Parties, Plaintiffs and Defendants, that whiles the one reads unto the Court, the other obſerves what he reads, out of his own copie, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent miſtakings, and thus to bring juſt things certainly into Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Nay, if it had not been a thing plotted and reſerved meerly for the means of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> ruine, Why did not Maſter <hi>Jones,</hi> his own Attorney, in reading it unto the Court, make that obſervation thereof, as it was his duty to have done when he came unto the place? And if the Proverb be true in any thing (that <hi>To excuſe is to accuſe</hi>) it was never more rightly verified then in this, for that it doth appear by the very Sentence it ſelf that Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> deſired of the Court that he might be ſworn, to purge and clear himſelf in the buſines, when he was not then at all charged with any wrong doing: And why ſhould Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> the ſaid Defendants At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169298:33"/>who had made ſo fair a Bill of Coſts as before, in his Clients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, now put himſelf further to be examined alſo in the matter, ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from all the rules of that Court, whereof ſure he could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; and was not ſo candid for him of all the reſt to have been done, being the Defendant; Attorney, and therefore ſhould rather have forborn to have medled in it, if to have avoided all ſuſpicion of partiality.</p>
                  <p>And as it is altogether improbable to have been done by Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi> ſo, if it had been done by him, (as it was not) yet was it not a matter ſo criminous and capitall, as that it deſerved a Cenſure in it ſelf:</p>
                  <p>For firſt of all, it was but the Paper-copie of a Record, which Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> might have burned, raſed, defaced, interlined, written in and done with it what he pleaſed, without offence: and he doth appeal to all that are of that Profeſſion, if daily and hourly they do not ſo uſe their Clients Paper-copies of Depoſitions, by drawing lines and croſſes, and writing in them, and yet was it never heard that any man before Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath been queſtioned for any ſuch doing, in caſe he had done it: But, <hi>ſome men had better ſteal a horſe, then another man look over the hedge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, Paper-copies of all Records, when they are produced as Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences at any hearings and trialls of cauſes, are no further credited and authentick then they ſtand clear and unſuſpected, and that this clearneſſe to be made appear; for before they be made uſe of, commonly they are firſt depoſed to be true copies of ſuch Records whereof they are copies; which ſhews them to be of no force nor to be uſed, untill they be thus juſtified in themſelves: and if at any time they paſſe for currant without this atteſtation in thoſe Courts where they are Records, it is becauſe they ſeem to be warranted to be truely copied under the hands of their own Clerks and Officers ſtill, and ſent in Court with the Record thereof, and which are ſworn to be faithfull in their proceedings, and ſtill ready with the ſame Records to juſtifie the ſame upon all occaſions. In whom then was the offence, to reade and make uſe of ſuch a Paper. copie which was in any thing ſuſpicious? and how frequent a thing is it in the courſe of practice of oftentimes to meet with ſuſpected Records, and with like Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Evidences? which if the party juſtifies not, or is not able to make good, are onely rejected and ſet aſide, without more ado, and made no uſe of. And if the ſame Depoſition upon queſtion had been juſtified by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> for aright copie, he had been worthy of cenſure; but you ſee there is no ſuch thing in this Caſe, nothing made appear that he ever did or deſired to make uſe of it; his counſel onely called to have that Depoſition read, which they might have omitted, had they pleaſed, there being other teſtimony ſufficient beſides to have proved that Charge.</p>
                  <p>And again, if Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had been guilty of the doing it, (as he was not) yet it is not a thng cenſurable. The common-Law doth puniſh offences of this nature no otherwiſe then with the loſſe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of that thing thus altered, or which might have accrued to the party by it in caſe it had not been altered: for whatſoever Obligations or other Deeds, which by any misfeazances, <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> become void, as by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlineation, addition, raſure, or drawing a pen thorow the midſt of a word, by theſe ways ſuch Deeds are all become void; but no other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted by the Law for theſe tranſgreſſions, but with the loſſe of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:169298:34"/>the fruit and benefit of ſuch Deeds, which is puniſhment ſufficient of it ſelf; and for to adde another affliction, were againſt a Rule of Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to puniſh a man double for one and the ſame offence: as in <hi>Matthewſon</hi> and <hi>Lideats</hi> Caſe, in the Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> fifth Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 25. <hi>Whelpdales</hi> Caſe, in the fifth Reports; and <hi>Pigots</hi> Caſe, in the eleventh Reports, <hi>fol.</hi> 27. where there are any other yeer-Books put for confirmation of this truth, and to prove the Law to be thus in his Caſe: And the Court of Star-Chamber have accuſtomedly followed and imitated the Rule of the common-Law in like caſes; and againſt whom Bills have been preferred there for like offences, the parties complained againſt have been diſmiſſed, though the offences proved as in the Caſes before cited of <hi>Allen</hi> and others: So that in this caſe the Peitioners Diſmiſſion and loſſe of that Teſtimony had been the uſuall puniſhment; but the loſſe of the fruit and benefit of his Suit had been too much: but to be cenſured for this as an offence in him, without proof of guilt, is without Preſident or Example.</p>

                  <p>Be pleaſed to obſerve, that all this interlocutory-Diſcourſe is but a bare repetition of this Conference, without proof or confeſſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unwarrantably entred into the Sentence, and againſt all the rules of proceeding in any Courts of Juſtice whatſoever. Howſoever, it ſhews thus much in the firſt place, that when ſuch things as theſe were ſuffered to be ſtufft into the Sentence, and to paſſe for currant, tending to the utter ruine of a man, Who could withſtand diſtruction, being in the hands of ſuch adverſaries? and who will not conclude of the injuſtice that was done him? The truth is, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> went then to <hi>Jones</hi> his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in <hi>Grays</hi>-Inne, being his Attorney, thinking to have had the Sentence drawn up againſt <hi>Yates,</hi> not ſuſpecting any ſuch action to have fallen out in the interim, after the hearing of the Cauſe; where he found theſe two
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169298:35"/>Attorneys <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi> together, conſulting, as it doth ſeem by the ſequel of their actions, how they might faſten this miſcarriage upon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Alexander:</hi> and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> deſiring to have the Sentence drawn up againſt <hi>Yates,</hi> they told him, It could not be; and then expreſſed the Reaſon, which as it was ſudden and unexpected, ſo it could not but drive him into wonder and admiration; which rather expreſſed his innocence, then any ways declared his guilt, to which purpoſe they endeavour to wreſt it. And the Books and Breviats having lien above three yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ready and prepared for the hearing, unſeen by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to that time; for <hi>nevile</hi> his Sollicitour had them in his cuſtodie a long time together, before the hearing, and managed them in Court; (and whether the Charge be true or falſe, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> muſt onely take it upon their credit) for he was never admitted to ſee the Book in which this Charge is mentioned to be done to this hour, albeit he hath diverſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured for to attain that favour and juſtice. Nor maketh it for their purpoſe, if his Anſwers were doubtfull to their Queſtion, of whom he had the Books; for the memory is not always ſo truſty and ready, that upon ſuch a ſudden ſurpriſall it can reſolve the Demand; it muſt be a work of Recollection that pofitively determines of things ſo long before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand acted. Nor was it materiall from thomſoever the Books were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: and in that time of neceſſity they muſt paſſe many times from hand to hand, to make ſuch preparation out of them as were fit to be made uſe of by Counſel and other2iſe, at the hearing; all which was done immediately after publication, above three yeers then before: But the matter was, Who committed that offence which <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi> were thus conſpiring together how to fix upon Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and therefore laboured to entrap and entangle him in his talk, which no fair practiſer, I had almoſt ſaid, No honeſt man would have endeavoured againſt his Client, nor no Attorney that had reſpected his credit, where his credit was no more concerned in it then Maſter <hi>Hookers.</hi> Then as for their going all together into the Examiners Studie to view the Record if it were ſo, ſhews, that all parties were doubtfull how the Depoſition ſtood; What inference can be then drawn from thence by any in different judgement, in the leaſt therfore to ſuſpect Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> guilty of this Accuſation? but ſerves to excuſe him rather, that thus laboured to be truely informed the firſt how it ſhould come about: and that Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> firſt vows and imprecations, as they are pleaſed to call them, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in their diſcourſe together, when they thus lay in wait to have intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him in that conference (if to be ſo as they alleadged, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver confeſſed, or proved by them) and that matter which Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> hath at ſeverall times declared upon his Oath for his own acquittall, are not ſo contradictory, diverſe, or uſefull to their cauſe, that any thing can be drawn from thence to make good the charge againſt him. And when that Point ſhall come to be cleared which is further contained in the Sentence concerning it, and which Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> hath depoſed, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhall give it a ſatisfactory anſwer. The Spirits of the men too may be obſerved, in this their Relation, towards Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> how far they are tranſported even with contempt to his perſon and quality, ſtanding in an equall degree with them every way, both in Birth and Fortune, that hath no ſo much addition given him by them as is due to

But, if it had been mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall, I could have put him in minde that he had all the Books by him in his Studie one whole long Vacation, which promiſe to have peruſed them, and did affirm to Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> he had ſo done, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his opinion of the proofs; and ſome of the copies of the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions taken by Commiſſion in the Countrey, were copied in his own Office, and his hand to the Examination. But to let that paſſe as imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent: I hope he hath now recollected himſelf better in this time that he hath been an <hi>Oxford</hi> with his Majeſtie, as Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> is informed. But, to examine his carriage towards his Maſter the King, and towards his Client Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in this particular in that time, be pleaſed to caſt an eye upon the Oath which the Attorneys of that Court, whiles it was in being, did take at their entring into their Offices: and ſurely himſelf, amongſt the reſt, took it for me.</p>

                  <p>It was further alſo contained amongſt the Rules and Orders of that Court concerning the Duties to have been performed by the ſeverall Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in their ſeverall Places, and amongſt the reſt, That the Attorneys of that Court were to look that their Clients cauſes were duely proſecuted to the hearing, without advantage: and that if they ſhould be preſſed by any Rules or Orders which might prejudice their Clients in their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they were to inform counſel, to move the Court therein: they were alſo to write the copies of all Bills, Anſwers, and of all Pleadings and Examinations taken in the Countrey by Commiſſion for their Clients, To prefer their Clients cauſes to hearing, To read all Acts, Evidences and Depoſitions before the Lords, To urge for their Clients, and after hearing, To draw up Bills of Coſts for his Lordſhip the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or Lord Keepers Taxations, and preſent them.</p>

It is agreed, he read this Depoſition at the hearing, for ſo it was his duty to do: and had he then behaved himſelf juſtly towards His Majeſtie, the Court and his Client, when he perceived the ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be marked in the margin, and ſo blotted in theſe words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) if they were ſo, as of neceſſity he muſt do, if his eyes were matches; had he then informed the Court thereof, as it was his duty to have done, and the proper time, the moſt that could have followed upon it had been but the ſetting aſide of that Depoſition as uſeleſſe; and then Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> could not have been denied to have made uſe of his other teſtimony, to have more fully proved that Charge, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Sentence againſt <hi>Yates</hi> had been continued, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had not been deſtroyed, nor had any prejudice happened to any man in the buſineſſe.</p>

                  <p>We have a Rule in Law, That in matters of contract between man and man committed to writing <hi>(clauſulae inconſuetae ſemper inducunt ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem)</hi> to adde unuſuall and unaccuſtomed Clauſes, do beget ſuſpition: and it hath been found by experience in common practice, That as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, when he intends to play a maſter-piece of deceit, will then transform himſelf into an Angel of light: ſo he that is about to cozen moſt, will uſe the moſt goodly and ſpecious pretences of all the reſt: but, <hi>By their works ye ſhall know them.</hi>

Whereupon, and upon ublike reading of the ſaid</hi> Alexanders <hi>Affidavit in open Court; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſome demands then made by the Court to the ſaid</hi> Alexander, <hi>there plainly appeared a repugnancy to truth, wherein he had catched himſelf, and diſcovered his guiltineſſe of the ſaid offence.</hi> 
                     <bibl>Fol. 4 in the Sentence.</bibl>
                  </q>
                  <p>Is it not ſomething ſtrange, that albeit Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was a caſtaway, and not worthy of like conſideration with theſe men? (yet that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the man ſhould not have the ſame meaſure of juſtice, and that which belong both to one thing, were not put both in one Caſe) that <hi>Nevile</hi> too was not preſently upon his Oath alſo declared to be innocent and free from the leaſt ſuſpition of the blotting out of theſe two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) out of the ſaid Paper-copie of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition? And ſurely there was great reaſon for the Court to have done ſo for the ſaid <hi>Nevile</hi> at that time alſo, if this matter alleadged in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence had been true, that ſuch a plain repugnancie to truth had then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Court, wherein Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had catched himſelf, and diſcovered his guiltineſſe of the ſaid offence; for this had made an end of all further queſtion about the buſineſſe: the Court might then have dealt with Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> as they pleaſed, without more ado: But how comes it about that the particulars wherein this guiltineſſe ſo appeared to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169298:37"/>the Court at that time were not regiſtred for poſterity, nor do now appear to make this Allegation good? The truth is, it is but a meer Fiction, ſome more of <hi>Matchivails</hi> dirt caſt in Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> face, to make him ſeem a little fouler in the eyes of his beholders: for, had it been ſo as 'tis ſet forth in the Sentence, no reaſonable man can think that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> could have eſcaped the judgement of the Court upon that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, without more ado, and <hi>frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest, per pauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ora.</hi> Surely the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> who at that time queſtioned and ſifted Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in Court, as Bran, with all poſſible endeavour to have gained this onely confeſſion from him, would have taken the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thereof, if it had been ſo, which had been <hi>inſtar mille testium,</hi> to have convinced him; and was the thing which was afterwards onely deſired to have been drawn from Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> by the further Examination of him before the Judges that very day, directed and ordered by the Court for to be done. Surely the Officers and Miniſters of the Court, now ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> would have accounted it a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of his pen to have catched it the firſt, before it had half fallen out of his mouth, and it would aſſuredly have been inſerted in the Sentence with a vengeance to him, that no publike Proclamation could have ſo openly divulged it to the world.</p>
                  <p>But that this is in the Sentence alſo, it is no wonder, when the whole is but a Recollection of Suppoſitions, inſerted in it without ground or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: And the truth is, the matter was made cock-ſure, in thoſe times, what by the power of the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> and Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> and other Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> like potent enemies, that this matter ſhould never have been ſtirred again, untill the day of the generall Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; as ſhall more fully appear by that which followeth.</p>

By this alſo you may pereceive, into what a ſad condition and ſtrait Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was driven, that having the ſupreme Judge and Officers of the Court for his adverſaries, he could procure no counſel that durſt to ſpeak or move in his cauſe, though never ſo juſt: ſo were men over-awed or related one unto another in thoſe days, that Juſtice had not his current and free paſſage, eſpecially in that Court; and that man muſt be ſacrificed unto ruine, upon whom the indignation and diſpleaſure of any ſuch as Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> adverſaries fell: And when he that would not comply with the times, ti being in any way that might hinder their deſignes, it was cauſe enough to deſtroy him. And what could Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> now expect but deſtruction, when that thing, whatſoever he ſpake for the juſtifying of himſelf had a contrary ſenſe and interpretation put upon it, and was inverted to his prejudice? Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel none would, nay durſt not, as they told me once, to ſpeak in it: for when at firſt they did a little offer ſome things cooly and faintly in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> behalf, and put for triall how it would be reliſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, they found it paſſed by in ſilence, if materiall, or themſelves diſ-regarded for the motion: And what wiſe man will engage himſelf in ſuch a quarrell, where, whoſoever ſpeeds, he is ſure to get blowes for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence?

                  <p>In this it is obſervable, as a Ground, That in all Courts of Juſtice whatſoever, the Rule is, That no man ought to be condemned, or to have judgement given againſt him for any matter depending in any Court of Judicature, but the Order or Proceſſe of that Court is firſt to iſſue, to give him timely notice of the reſolution of the Judges of thoſe Courts to proceed to Judgement at ſome certain time prefixed, that ſo no man may be overtaken uprovided, or without making his juſt Defence; (except ſuch party as after notice ſhall wilfully abſent or not provide by counſel or otherwiſe, for to juſtifie himſelf in his proceedings) and, without this, many an innocent man would be undone: And in caſe where neither the partie, by himſelf or by his Counſel, ſhall appear to defend himſelf after ſuch notice, and that the warning doth ſufficiently appear unto that Court to have been given him according to direction, that there be no delay in juſtice, the Court will proceed to judgement without him; yet with ſuch caution, as, if poſſible, they will not do him injuſtice for his contumacy therein, nor will wrong their conſciences in the Judgement; but will try out the truth howſoever by all means, for whatſoever lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: and therefore in ſuch caſes of abſence, they hear all ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, Depoſitions of Witneſſes, and other matters of Record lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to be read, which before that time the party hath made for his Defence, or that he hath alleadged for maintenance of any Charge in ſuch an Action or Proceeding, and will in ſuch caſe be much more wary and circumſpect to promote the truth, of whatſoever ſide it is, appearing within the Books, then if ſuch party had been preſent: for Judges ſit not to ſide, and make parties, or to take opportunities to revenge themſelves; but for to do juſtice and judgement truely and impartially, for juſtice ſake, without the reſpect of perſons. But then ſee if Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> have received this meaſure of juſtice in this matter concerning him: An Order of notice for a hearing hath been made; and that was well: but that this was ſhewn to Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> or that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had notice of this Order, doth in no ſort appear: Nor had he any notice thereof; for firſt, <hi>Bagſhaws</hi> Oath reacheth no further then unto an Endeavour of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; he ſwears nothing poſitively, to ſatisfie the Court that it weas done. And for what <hi>Nevile</hi> offered for notice, as it is far from truth, ſo alſo it is ſo far out of the way of a legal notice, as it appears both to be falſe in it ſelf, appearing out of the very Sentence, and in no ſort to have been credited or
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169298:39"/>believed, in caſe it had been true, for this Reaſon, Becauſe it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon Oath for a Record; againſt which Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> might have taken his remedy for the falſity of it, being untrue.

                           <hi>CHarles Bagſhaw</hi> of <hi>Barnards</hi>-Inne, <hi>London,</hi> Gent. aged about thirty ſeven yeers, ſworn, ſaith, That where, by an Order of this honourable Court of the <hi>10</hi> of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> day is given to <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> Eſquire, till the next Sitting-day, to ſhew cauſe, by his counſel or otherwiſe, why the Court ſhould not proceed to ſentence againſt him; and that he the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be preſent at the Bar in perſon: Now this Examinate ſaith, That on the thirteenth day of this inſtant <hi>November,</hi> this Examinate did repair to the Chamber of the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, and there knocked at the door: but no anſwer being made, this Examinate walked a little aſide. Within a ſhort ſpace, the door was opened, and a young man or youth coming out, and looking about, as it ſeemed, to ſee who it was that knocked: Which this Examinate ſeeing, did ask the young man or youth if he were not Master <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk or man, and where his Maſter was: who then confeſſed, that the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was his Maſter; but that his ſaid Master was not within, neither could he tell where his Master was. And then <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> Clerk to Maſter <hi>Jones,</hi> one of the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of this Court, came into the Chamber, and asked the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk for his Maſter; who returning the like anſwer as he had done to this Examinate: Whereupon, the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> delivered a copie of the ſaid Order to the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> man, willing him to give his Maſter preſent knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: which he ſaid he would do, aſſoon as he did ſee him. And this Examinate is perſwaded, that the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> hath had knowledge of the ſaid Order, his man faithfully promiſing to deliver it ſo ſoon as he could: Both this Examinate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169298:39"/>and the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevile</hi> charged him ſo to do, and telling him how much it concerned his Maſter to take notice thereof.</p>

                  <p>This Affdavit, how cunningly ſoever penned by Maſter <hi>Nevile,</hi> and that he hath carried himſelf in it, yet is no good ſervice of the ſaid Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as hath been obſerved before; for <hi>Nevile</hi> well knew, Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> was at this time, and above a week before, out of Town, when he went with <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> to make this ſervice upon the ſaid Order, to <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne. And in all caſes of this nature, where a like Order or Proceſſe is ſerved to cauſe any to appear to hear Judgement, it ought to be firſt made clear unto the Court, that the party to be ſerved, if poſſible, hath had perſonall notice, before they proceed to ſentence, it being ſo penall as aforeſaid: And if it be not a perſonall ſervice made, yet then that there be ſuch a ſervice made, appearing unto the Court, as by infallible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the party muſt have had knowledge of it, in convenient time to prepare himſelf for his Defence: for, in matters of giving judgement, it is not as in other ordinary Caſes, of ſerving Proceſſe to anſwer Bills, or interlocutory-Orders; where, if by a miſtake, or preſſing the ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the truth, the party fall into a contempt, of this he may purge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his Oath upon Interrogatories, according to the uſuall courſe, and ſo be ſet <hi>Rectus in Curia</hi> again, and have repair made him without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment to his Cauſe: But where Judgements or Sentences are to be given, either in the Courts of common-Law, or Equity, or Star-Chamber, there, if for want of notice, or that upon a falſe ſervice of Proceſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Court, the Court proceed to give judgement againſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is no ſuch Remedy to be had; nothing but a Writ of Errour, or Bill of review or reverſall of ſuch Judgement or Sentence, can reſtore the the party again to what he hath thus loſt or, ſhall ſuffer by it: and ſuch Judgement or Sentence may poſſibly in ſuch caſes be ſo legally founded, that they cannot be avoided by any ſuch way neither; and yet ſuch parties may poſſibly have had ſuch matter of fact to have ſhewn for themſelves upon thoſe hearings, if they had been heard, as would have acquitted them. The ſervice of this Order by <hi>Bagſhawe,</hi> you ſee what it is; His repair to Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Chamber, unto <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne, where Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was not, and who will be depoſed, that he was gone out of Town, about his occaſions aforeſaid, above a week before, in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: And though it be commonly preſumed, a man will be, for the moſt part, at his own houſe, which is his Caſtle, for to manage his eſtate, and to provide for his family; there is no ſuch intendment or neceſſity of a mans being at his chamber in another place, remote from his dwelling-houſe, as this was, neer 100 miles diſtant: and therefore the leaving of this Order, in a caſe ſo penall, at his chamber here in <hi>London,</hi> where he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169298:40"/>was tied to no conſtant reſidence, but might ſtay and be gone again at his pleaſure, without preciſe proof of his being there: and perſonall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, before the hearing, was no ſuch ſervice of that Order as did warrant that Court to proceed to Judgment againſt him in his abſence, and without defence. Again obſerve, albeit in the Setence it be expreſſed, that a copie of this Order was left with Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Boy or Clerk at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne; yet the Affidavit of <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> ſays not ſo; for he ſwears onely, He gave it to a young man or youth of whom he enquired if he were not Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk or man, and where his Maſter was; who then confeſſed, that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was his Maſter; but that his ſaid Maſter was not within, neither could he tell where he was: But his ſaying ſo, doth not make him ſo, if in truth he were not ſo; and all this doth not prove him to be ſo: So tis clear, <hi>Bagſhawe</hi> knew him not to be Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk or man; and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had more chamber-fellows that had Clerks and men then in Town, to whom it was certainly delivered by ſome willing miſtake, to make thus much of it in colour for the hearing. And what <hi>Nevile</hi> delivered, who was this <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws</hi> ſetter, was ſtill but to this miſtaken Clerk or man, and therefore no whit to have been regarded for ſuch a ſervice. Nor was it <hi>Bagſhaws</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of notice, nor <hi>Neviles</hi> charge to that Clerk or man to deliver the ſaid copie of the ſaid Order to Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> that therefore concluded, He had notice, or that it was delivered unto him accordingly, as it was not. And if it had been Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk or man, <hi>Nevile</hi> knew him, and his name: for Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> ſaith, He attended with the Books at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cauſe againſt <hi>Yates;</hi> and that he took the ſaid Depoſition of <hi>John Warrens</hi> for him, and ſhewed it to the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry:</hi> Other Clerk or man Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had not; and if it had been he, <hi>Nevile</hi> would have cauſed him to have been named; for he had a Chriſtian-name and Sir-name, but was not then in Town, as Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth: So it is likely they ſet up a man of ſtraw, and killed him when they had done: either feigned the being of ſome ſuch man or Clerk there, that was not; or delivered the ſame to ſome man or Clerk that was no man or Clerk of Maſter <hi>Alexanders,</hi> and by a willing miſtake, made this uſe of it to condemn him in his abſence. Howſoever, it was no good ſervice in it ſelf, for the reaſons aforeſaid: and the Court was abuſed by inſerting in the Sentence, either what <hi>Nevile</hi> voluntarily affirmed, clean from the matter; and that <hi>Bagſhaw</hi> ſhould depoſe that the copie of the ſaid Order was left with Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Clerk or man, which he did not ſwear at all. And of neceſſity muſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> make default at the hearing, when he was ſo long before gone out of Town, and had no manner of notice, nor could have notice poſſibly of the ſaid intended hearing. And for his withdrawing himſelf, you have heard the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when; and therefore no ways worthy of blame, or that any uſe ought to have been made of it, to his ſo great diſadvantage.</p>

                        <p>ACcording to an Order of this honourable Court of the <hi>27</hi> of <hi>October</hi> last, we have examined the parties concerning the blotting out of two words in the Depoſition of one <hi>John Warren, viz.</hi> (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) being for the advantage of the Plaintiff <hi>Alexander:</hi> And we have likewiſe examined Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> one of the Attorneys of this Court: <hi>Gay</hi> the Examiner, that took the Examination, and <hi>Wright</hi> the Clerk that wrote them, being both dead.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Nevile</hi> denieth the altering of <hi>Warrens</hi> Depoſition, and ſaith, He never ſaw it from the time it was first taken out, till it was read in Court: He denieth that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, or any other, to his knowledge, did alter the ſame; and that he never exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the copie with the Original; neither did the Plaintiff ever leave the ſame with <hi>Nevile</hi> to be examined: He denieth the having of any Reward for Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation thereof, for he was never required to examine the ſame.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alexander</hi> denieth expreſly the alteration of <hi>Warrens</hi> Depoſition, or that it was done by him, or by any other by his procurement: He ſaith, He went to Maſter <hi>Hudſon,</hi> to peruſe his Depoſitions, being of Counſel with him: And that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>John Warren,</hi> when Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> peruſed the ſame, was without any blotting or alteration; and that the two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) were then fair in the ſame copie, not ſcored nor blotted: And Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> told him, upon peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the ſame, That it was but upon hearſay, and made not for him: Whereupon this Examinate told him, That divers were preſent at an Arbitrement intended, when it was ſpoken preciſely by <hi>Robert Warren,</hi> and not by hearſay: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> adviſed him to examine it with the Record: Whereupon he went to <hi>Nevile,</hi> and ſhewed him the Depoſition, and what Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thereof: and then <hi>Nevile</hi> would have blotted out thoſe two words, if this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate had not reſtrained him. And after, they went to the Examiners Office, to have compared it with the Originall: But he being not then to be found, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169298:41"/>left the Depoſitions with <hi>Nevile,</hi> and afterwards received the ſame again from <hi>Nevile</hi> with thoſe two words blotted out, the ſame being done without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of procurement. And this Examinate ſaith, That the Cauſe was heard in this Court the ſame day he went to examine the copie with the Record, and found the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to be fair, with thoſe two words in the ſame, whereat this Examinate was much aſtoniſhed.</p>
                        <p>Being asked what extraordinary rewards <hi>Nevile</hi> received from him in the ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing of his Cauſe, ſaith, That in the Term he went to Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> for advice, he gave <hi>Nevile</hi> ſix ſhillings before he went to Maſter <hi>Hudſon:</hi> And when he had the Book from <hi>Nevile, Nevile</hi> demanded of him two ſhillings, as a Fee due to the Examiner. But <hi>Nevile</hi> denieth that he had any money of him that Term; and thinketh in his conſcience, That, for the drawing of the Bill, and drawing part of the Interrogatories, and his care and pains as a Clerk in the Cauſe, he hath not had above thirty ſhillings ſince the beginning thereof, being about ſix yeers past; nor that he had ever any thing from him ſince the Term the Cauſe was publiſhed in, which was <hi>viceſimo Jacobi,</hi> and copies of Books delivered, ſaving of ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys as he laid out for him in Court, and ten ſhillings in money, he having laid out of his purſe nine ſhillings four pence thereof before.</p>
                        <p>Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> depoſeth, That in the afternoon the ſame day the Cauſe was heard in court, M. <hi>Alexander</hi> met with M. <hi>Jones</hi> his Attorney and the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in <hi>Grays</hi>-Inne, where they went together to M. <hi>Jones</hi> his Study; and ſeeing the Depoſition there, ſeemed thereupon to be in a great paſsion or perplexity about the blotting out and defacing of the two words <hi>(that</hi> and <hi>did)</hi> out of <hi>Warrens</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſaying, <hi>What an unfortunate man am I! what will become of me?</hi> And being asked by this Deponent, From whom he had received the Paper-copie, ſaid, He could not tell whether he had it from <hi>Nevile,</hi> or from the Examiner him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but ſaid and ſwore, He altered it not, nor knew who altered the ſame; but that the copie was as he received it; and affirmed as much upon the view of the originall Examination with the Examiner: Howbeit, <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Affidavit depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, He left the copie of the Depoſitions with <hi>Nevil,</hi> to be examined, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from him again; <hi>Nevil</hi> telling him, He had examined them whith the Original, and that he had then made it to agree with the Record.

                  <p>And now be pleaſed to obſerve if there by any ſuch contrarieties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit and the ſaid Certificate of the Iudges as is alleadged in the Sentence. It muſt needs be, that the Affidavit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn by Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> after his own way, as he underſtood the matter; and the Certificate, being made by direction of the Iudges, who did interrogate Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> as they pleaſed, and ſo to ſet down things
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169298:41"/>after their own order and manner, there may be ſome ſeeming difference, in words, and phraſe of ſpeech; but for ſubſtance, there is no manner of contrariety or variation at all. This is more in the Certificate, then in the Affidavit, That <hi>ſo ſoon as Maſter</hi> Alexander <hi>did ſhew the ſaid</hi> Iohn Warrens <hi>Depoſition to the ſaid</hi> Nevil, <hi>with the doubt in the Depoſition conceived by his Counſel, and the mark applied to it in the margin of the Paper-copie,</hi> Nevil <hi>would then have preſently blotted out thoſe two words</hi> (that <hi>and</hi> did) <hi>if Master</hi> Alexander <hi>had not reſtrained him.</hi> Which croſſe nothing at all in the Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit; but makes <hi>Nevil</hi> the more culpable, and more clearly appear to be the man that did the fact: for he, that would then have done it before Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> face, without ever examining it with the Record, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He knew it to be but a miſtake; 'tis more likely he would do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinder Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> back.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo contained in the Iudges Certificate, more then in the Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Maſter</hi> Alexander <hi>going to the Office to examine the Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Record, and finding thoſe two words</hi> (that <hi>and</hi> did) <hi>fair in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, was much aſtoniſhed:</hi> Which word, <hi>aſtoniſhed,</hi> is not in the Affidavit; yet doth not this contradict any thing in the Affidavit, but the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> innocence of the fact: For, aſtoniſhment is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Compurgatour, then an Accuſer; not ariſing from guiltineſſe, but from a meer other thing: As, that a man being ſurpriſed with a ſudden Accuſation, (as in this Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was) though armed with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that he cannot be pierced; yet may he be amazed with ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a charge. It oftentimes proceeds from ſenſibleneſſe of diſgrace, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, though innocent, to be within the ſuſpicion of ſuch faults; or that he hath carried himſelf ſo, that any tongue durſt be ſo impudent as to lay it to his charge. May happen from a diſability to acquit himſelf at the inſtant, his integrity wanting rather clearing then clearneſſe: therefore ſaith <hi>Job, The upright man ſhall be aſtoniſhed at this, and the innocent ſhall ſtir up him ſelf againſt the hypocrites, Job</hi> 17.8. The very Diſciples were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at Chriſts words, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.34. and in the 26 verſe it is ſaid, <hi>They were aſtoniſhed</hi> ſo <hi>out of meaſure, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved?</hi> ſhewing how difficult a thing it is for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And ſo in many other places of Scripture, aſtoniſhment is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken in a good ſenſe. And thus 'tis plain, that upright and innocent men are oftentimes aſtoniſhed: So that upon obſervation of both, there is not eny variation or contrariety in Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit, and his Examination before the Iudges in matter of ſubſtance at all; but the ſame is untruely alleadged in the Sentence without ground or warrant, to make for their purpoſe againſt the truth.</p>
                  <p>And as to that part of the Certificate from the Iudges which concerns <hi>Nevils</hi> Examinations; as it is onely to excuſe himſelf of an offence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſtood firſt charged; and as it was unwarrantably grounded and admitted to be done at firſt: ſo you finde them not preſſed, nor any uſe made of them at all, firſt or laſt: And ſince, for reaſons beſt known unto the Court, they ſet them aſide as uſeleſſe and not warranted; and for which there was great reaſon ſo to do. So they ſhall need no other Anſwer. And as ſure as there is a God in heaven, ſo certain it is, that what <hi>Nevil</hi> hath therin ſaid is contrary to the truth, and ſo afterwards did thrive according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and M. <hi>Alexander</hi> could have diſproved all of it by many Witneſſes,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169298:42"/>ſaving that onely part concerning his blotting out the words; which he did, or cauſed to be done, as God is true.</p>
                  <p>Then, as to that other part of the ſaid Certificate, which mentions Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Hookers</hi> Examinations and Teſtimony in this buſineſſe, it maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to croſſe any thing ſaid by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: And it hath partly received an Anſwer formerly, as it is mentioned in the Sentence to be a Diſcourſe between Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> and him, in Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Studie in <hi>Grays</hi>-Inne, the day the cauſe was heard between Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Yates:</hi> But the Bent and Scope of all that was, To enſnare and intangle Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in his talk, and to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from his words or carriage whatſoever might poſ2ibly make to charge the offence on him: therefore he ſaith, firſt, That Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have been in a great paſſion and perplexity, about the blotting out of thoſe words: but that which ſeemeth to be a thing, is not the ſame: <hi>Nullum ſimile eſt idem.</hi> And what followed from thence? Would it not have perplexed any man, or aſtoniſh him, on ſuch a ſudden to underſtand all his buſineſſe to be ſo changed, his adverſary releaſed, whom he left in cuſtodie upon a Sentence pronounced againſt him; and upon the point de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be diſmiſſed with his coſts, when Maſter <hi>Alixander</hi> expected to have had coſts from him, and that juſtly? Might not M. <hi>Alexander</hi> term it alſo an unfortunate thing, to be thus dealt withall on all hands; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that thoſe which ſhould have aſſiſted him in ſetting things right again, went thus about for to betray him? But fain this Gentleman would wreſt or pick ſomething out of theſe words, and take an advantage of his own wrong.</p>
                  <p>To make ſome thing againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> out of this Diſcourſe, ſo ſaid to catch him and ſurpriſe him, that when they asked him, <hi>From whom he had received the Paper-copie,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He could not tell whether he had them from</hi> Nevil, <hi>or from the Examiner himſelf.</hi> If he ſaid ſo, What of this? hath not many a man in ordinary diſcourſe, and being taken upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, to anſwer to things done long before, ſaid that, which, upon ſecond thoughts, and coming to be depoſed thereupon afterwards, upon delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and recollecting of himſelf, he hath varied from? And was this ever yet counted an offence in any man, but in Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> to be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed of that he ſwears for truth? And yet if what paſſed from him in this diſcourſe ſhall be rightly weighed and conſidered, there is nothing in it that in the leaſt makes againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> or that croſſeth any thing which he hath either ſworn or ſpoken in the defence of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                  <p>Tis true, Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> would invert the meaning of the words to a fained and ſtrained ſenſe, as if it ſhould imply a contrariety, that once Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould ſay, He knew not from whom he had the copie, and then afterwards ſhould depoſe the matter ſo preciſely againſt <hi>Nevil,</hi> as to make him the offender. To that other Anſwer which Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> hath already given of ſpeaking words in paſſion, and upon bare diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and after depoſing to the ſame matter upon ſecond thoughts, and deliberation, adde this, and conſider that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in his Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit depoſeth, That there were two receivings of this copie of the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of <hi>John Warren:</hi> the firſt time from the Examiner, or <hi>Nevil,</hi> when he took it and carried it to his Counſel Maſter <hi>Hudſon</hi> to peruſe; and at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169298:42"/>that time it is not materiall from which of them he received it; for it makes nothing one way or other from which of them he then had it: but ſure he is, that <hi>Nevil</hi> got that copie and all other copies from him, which he had of any thing done in the Office, or otherwiſe, in that Cauſe; elſe what need ſhould Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> have had of his ſollicitation, and to have done the work himſelf? And all that were Sollicitours in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as he was, did ſo for their Clients; it was their duties, and for that onely they had their wages: But then when Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had thus carried it to his Counſel, who had peruſed it, and directed it to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the Record, with a mark in the margin made againſt it; then it was delivered again to <hi>Nevil</hi> for that purpoſe, and then Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> afterwards received it the ſecond time from <hi>Nevil</hi> again, with the words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) ſo defaced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this later receiving was that receiving of this copie from Maſter <hi>Nevil,</hi> when this alteration was committed: So that upon the firſt Conference the Anſwer was made, as it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and according to the times and places where it was propounded and anſwered, that is to ſay, in Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Studie, and the Examiners Office, which related to that receiving of them the firſt of all; and that might be delivered doubtfull, without any diſadvantage, and yet Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Oath ſtands clear too, and without exception, that he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the further carriage of the buſineſſe to make the truth appear; and all ſtands very well together: And tis againſt the Rule, to fetch blood out of a mans words, and to ſtrain an intendment thereof beyond the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine meaning of the ſpeaker; and therefore in Law they are always to be taken in <hi>mitiori ſenſu,</hi> moſt favourable for him that ſpeaks them, where by any means they might be wreſted to a contrary interpretation. But then Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> doth further expreſſe theſe other words alſo falling from Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in that diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> then ſhould have <hi>ſaid and ſwore, He altered it not, nor knew who altered the ſame;</hi> and that being true, How could he ſay that <hi>Nevil</hi> did it? Both are true, and contradicts nothing of whatſoever Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath either ſaid or ſworn in this matter, when once rightly underſtood. For the firſt, that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> did it not, that is true, and hath been continually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and juſtified by Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> both upon his words, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Oath, firſt and laſt. Then, that he knew not who altered the ſame, alſo well ſtandeth with his Depoſition: for, he depoſeth the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how he left it with <hi>Nevil</hi> to be examined with the Record; and that afterward <hi>Nevil</hi> gave it him again ſo blotted as it was; and that <hi>Nevil</hi> did it, or cauſed it to be done; and ſo Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> could not know who actually did it, whether <hi>Nevil</hi> himſelf, or any other, and yet received ſo done from <hi>Nevil,</hi> and was ſo his offence equally, whether done by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or by his direction; and therefore Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſtands the more clear in his Oath, being made with this caution: and he who doth a thing by another, ſeemeth to do it by himſelf: and in common parliance, men do uſe to ſay, I have done ſuch a thing or ſuch a thing for you, when he hath onely cauſed and procured it to have been done for him by another, aſſuming the act as his, that hath been done by his procurement: And ſo Maſter <hi>Nevil</hi> did ſay, He had made it to agree with the Record, although he ſpeaketh this falſly, to make Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> the rather believe it; and therefore it was more ſafe for Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:169298:43"/>to depoſe the manner how, that he delivered the copie to him fair, and received it with thoſe alterations; and that either <hi>Nevil</hi> did it himſelf, or cauſed it to be done, which in effect was one and the ſame thing, and thus not poſſible for Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to know who actually did it. There is this alſo more remarkable in Maſter <hi>Hookers</hi> Examinations upon his Oath, and in his Relation of the Conference which paſſed between him, Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> his Studie: For in court, when he was demanded his knowledge of what paſſed in that Diſcourſe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his oath, he anſwered, and ſo tis alleadged in the Sentence that he ſhould relate, That Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould then ſay, <hi>That the Paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copie of</hi> John Warrens <hi>Depoſitionwas as he firſt received it:</hi> But in his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations upon Oath before the Judges, he leaves out this word, <hi>firſt,</hi> and ſays, that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> anſwered his queſtion, <hi>That the ſaid copie was as he received it;</hi> which makes a very main and great difference: for this word <hi>firſt</hi> being added, (as they had ſtudied it) made much for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; that is to ſay, If it were ſo as when Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> firſt received it, then how could <hi>Nevil</hi> blot out thoſe words afterwards, eſpecially if Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> received it from the Examiner, to which ſenſe they would preſſe the meaning of the words, and then there muſt be a meer repugnancie to truth in ſuch caſe, and an impoſſibility in that, and ſo at firſt bluſh to a curſary underſtanding of the words, <hi>Nevile</hi> muſt of force be clear of the Accuſation, and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> catched, as they are elſewhere pleaſed to call it, in this matter. But you ſee God will have truth come to light, in deſpight of the adverſary; and therefore Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> when he onely ſays, without Oath, then he ſpeaks one thing; but when he is examined upon his Oath before the Judges, then he ſays ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: And the words ſpoken by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> being no other, but, <hi>That the copie of the ſaid Depoſition was as he received it,</hi> agrees in terms with Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Affidavit in all things, which is, <hi>That it was as he received it the ſecond time from</hi> Nevil, <hi>after that it was left with him to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the Record; and that he delivered it back again to</hi> Maſter <hi>Alexander, and ſaid, That he had examined it, and made it to agree with the Record.</hi> And thus Maſter <hi>Hookers</hi> teſtimony makes nothing againſt Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> teſtimony at all. And obſerve further, that even Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> himſelf is enforced to flee unto that common Rule of ſecond thoughts to be more ſage and certain, and that there is a difference between words ſpoken at randome, and in ordinary diſcourſe, and afterwards premiſed, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a ſolemn Oath. And obſerve further, that in the beginning of the Sentence pronounced againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> it is related as if depoſed by Maſter <hi>Hooker,</hi> That upon that Conference Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould affirm this thing, with many and heavie imprecations and oaths, vowing and proteſting, He knew not of the blotting out of thoſe two words (<hi>that</hi> and <hi>did</hi>) in the ſaid Depoſition: Which is inſerted, of purpoſe to make Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſeem little conſcientious of what he ſwore judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that valued oaths and imprecations nothing in his ordinary diſcourſe. But of this Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> likewiſe ſays nothing in his Examinations upon Oath before the Judges; (dealing in it indeed very clearly; for there was no ſuch matter) And yet this alſo ſhews, that Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> was not ſo conſtant to his relations, but that he knew a difference what it was to ſay, and what to ſwear. And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> doth appeal to all men that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169298:43"/>have known his converſation both before and ſince, if ever he were addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to that abominable vice of taking the bleſſed Name of God in vain. But ſee what the devil can do, when he wants truth for his accuſations; and obſerve unto what ſhifts and ſubterfuges men are brought, when they do clothe injuſtice with a ſeeming-holineſſe. And after all this, conſider yet this further, that if Maſter <hi>Hooker</hi> had not been <hi>Yates</hi> his Attorney in that Cauſe, and had not preferred ſuch an unwarrantable Bill of Coſts againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> as he did, and had not joyned with Maſter <hi>Jones</hi> with his utmoſt endeavours to have fixed the offence upon Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> as he did, and that he had not been a Witneſſe for <hi>Nevile</hi> free from all exceptions, as he was not, and had ſworn ſomething to the purpoſe for the clearing of <hi>Nevile,</hi> as he did not; yet then he had been but <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris Testis,</hi> to whom <hi>nullafides</hi> in the Cauſe, whereupon to have grounded a Sentence againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in that matter: Tis true, when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vehement and ſtrong preſumptions are coupled together, ſometimes a ſingle and clear teſtimony beyond all exception, rarely, in matters Civil, and betwixt party nd party, relief hath been thereupon afforded unto the oppreſſed: but in matters Criminall, where the life, many times, and that which is always as dear and neer unto a good Chriſtian, His good Name, hath been queſtioned, and in danger, from the mouth of two or three Witneſſes at the leaſt, according to our Saviours Precept; in that caſe the Judgement hath onely been eſtabliſhed. And before I end this part of the Sentence, let me obſerve unto you one thing more, That theſe good Judges who took theſe Examinations, one of them yet living, Sir <hi>Randal Crewe</hi> Knight, then Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> a man fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for his piety and juſtice, and that in thoſe times choſe rather to be diſcharged of his place, then to ſerve curns againſt his conſcience: and Maſter Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge,</hi> known to be a learned and juſt man; yet theſe two that made the Certificate, would neither of them be drawn into Court to give a Sentence or an opinion againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> therein; which they well underſtood muſt have been done againſt their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and againſt the truth.</p>

And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in this caſe doth alſo appeal to all men, if it were poſſible for the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent man alive, being thus dealt withall, or howſoever, to be free from deſtruction, when the Pale of the Law was thus broken down, and all things admitted to enter, without form or truth, to confound him that was but ooked upon with an evil eye, as averſe unto thoſe times, and ſuſpected might prove hurtfull to their deſignes; and when that power of diſpenſing the Laws for protecting the innocent, was put into the hands of thoſe which wreſted it to their own ends, for the very oppreſſion of the ſubject. but Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> hath done herein, as <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> told his dream: He tells his wiſe-men that he had a dream, but never tells them what it was.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, There was not ſo much ſmoke, but ſure there was ſome fire; and therefore though this Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> hath miſſed the Cuſhion, yet there lies ſome Pad hid in the Straw, which, if it could be diſcovered and found out, would happily make out ſomething which Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> drives at: Therefore Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath made a ſtrict ſcrutiny into himſelf, if poſſible, to finde out this man, and his meaning, and ſaith, That he cannot remember what this <hi>Cook</hi> ſhould be, or what this matter ſhould mean, if not this.</p>
                  <p>About the ſeventeenth yeer of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, there was then one <hi>Thomas Cook,</hi> a young man, who, by one Maſter <hi>Thomas Clowdſley,</hi> ſometimes an Attorney in the Court of Common-Pleas, his father in law, was put unto <hi>Ryce Gwin</hi> Eſquire, after Serjeant at Law, dwelling in the ſame Town with Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to be one of his Clerks; with whom this Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> continued for ſome time: And ſo it fell out, that in this time of their neighbouring together, Maſter Serjeant <hi>Gwin</hi> conceived ſome cauſleſſe diſpleaſure againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and waited but the opportunity to be revenged. Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in this time had
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169298:45"/>purchaſed from a kinſman of his, one Maſter <hi>Thomas Plandon,</hi> as much land as came to 600 <hi>l.</hi> or thereabouts, for which he had given ſeverall Bonds for the payment of the money in time: But Maſter <hi>Plandon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being deſirous to travell beyond the Seas, intreated ready money, and compounded to rebate for the time, to be ſupplied with the main Sum preſently. Whereupon they concluded, and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> paid him the money: But becauſe the Bonds were not in Maſter <hi>Plandons</hi> hands for the preſent, he gave Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> a particular Acquittance for the ſame debt, at firſt; and not long after, anotyher more generall Releaſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finiſhing of all demands between them. Maſter <hi>Plandon</hi> having ſpent his money, and being returned, and growing into all wants and extreme neceſſities, a fit time to be wrought upon by evil Counſel; and having yet the main Obligation in his hands, undelivered up, he made ſhew of it to others as a reall debt, and by that means wrought himſelf into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of thoſe that were more ready to believe it againſt Maſter <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> then he to utter it, and reſolved to engage with him to make it a queſtion. Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> prefers his Bill in equity, to have the Bond delivered up. Maſter <hi>Plandon,</hi> and this Maſter <hi>Cook,</hi> then become an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney at Law, do commence a Suit againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> upon the Bond; and with them many more joyn to manage the Cauſe, all his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter amongſt the reſt, if by any means, to recover it: Their proſecution was with ſuch ſpeed, and ſuch favour, as the matter was ſoon brought unto a Triall. Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Attorney having both Acquittances in his hands, pleads in Bar to the Action that which was more particular. Whereupon. Iſſue being joyned, a Jury was pickt out for the purpoſe; and the matter came to Triall before Maſter Juſtice <hi>Dodderidge</hi> at <hi>Thetford</hi>-Aſſizes, when Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> proved the ſealing and delivery of the Releaſe. But it ſo fell out, as there was one word interlined in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, not any thing to the eſſence of the Deed, which Maſter <hi>Plandons</hi> Counſel, and Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> his Attorney preſſed to have been inſerted after the ſealing and delivery thereof, and ſo, if true, the Releaſe void: And there being but one fingle Witneſſe to that Releaſe, being made in haſte at Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> houſe, a mile and more diſtant from any Town, and between kinſmen, and on a time when Maſter <hi>Plandon</hi> poſted his diſpatch and departure upon his occaſions; and although Maſter <hi>Plandon,</hi> being preſent at the Triall, did not deny it to be his hand and ſeal, though he was directed to confeſſe nothing more that made agaiſt him; and albeit the ſaid Witneſſe being a ſubſtantiall Ycoman of the Countrey, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all exception that teſtified the ſealing and delivery thereof unto Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the truth was; and albeit Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> produced his other generall Releaſe, teſtified by many Witneſſes, though not pleaded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the debt appeared to be fully ſatisfied: yet, upon this device and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and having obtained a Jury for that purpoſe, he gained a Verdict againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> for the whole penalty of the Obligation; which they after purſued with that eagerneſſe, and obtained ſuch favour by the friendſhip they had, and means they uſed in the Courts of Juſtice, that preſently they obtained Judgement, and took Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in Execution: And being thus reſtrained, and in priſon, for ſo great a demand, which he was no ways able to ſatisfie, without ſale of his Lands: And the ſubſiſtence of himſelf, his wife and family princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169298:45"/>depending upon his endeavours in the courſe of his Profeſſion; and being then in a fair way of Advancement, being employed by many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friends, and having many Stewardſhips, and other employments of like nature, which of neceſſity he muſt have forgone, and loſt the benefit of, and been ruined in all, if to continue in reſtraint whiles he ſhould in a legall way queſtion the injuſtice and miſcarriages of thoſe proceedings; and being involved in ſo great a ſtrait, was adviſed and perſwaded by his friends (although, he muſt confeſſe, much againſt his wil) rather to ſit down under the burden, then to be ruined both in his eſtate and profeſſion alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And they having <hi>M. Alexander</hi> at this advantage, as the leaſt of theſe evils, he was thus enforced, for his enlargement, to ſell his Lands to pay this great debt over again, and to give them a generall Releaſe into the bargain, (for that they would have the firſt of all) or elſe he muſt lie by it, and be ruine and loſt in his Fortune and eſtate: And when <hi>M. Alexander,</hi> upon this Agreement, had the bond delivered up, which by his plea was confeſſed, he found that his kinſman had been more juſt then he expected; for he found the bond had been cancelled, and the Seal cloſed down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the old place with a little Starch; which then it was too late to call in queſtion: beſides that, <hi>M. Alexander</hi> ſaw little hopes to right himſelf by any Suit of Law for ſo great an injury, for that he underſtood his ſaid kinſman had ſhared and divided the greateſt part of the money preſently amongſt thoſe that were his abettours and aſſiſtants; and that he had given 100 <hi>l.</hi> for Counſel-Fees, and 60 <hi>l.</hi> or thereabouts for Attorneys Fees and Clerks Fees, whereof this <hi>M. Cook</hi> had the greateſt ſhare, and other great Sums of money to others that did him ſervice in the buſineſſe: And, <hi>'Tis an ill winde blowes no man unto good.</hi> This Conqueſt thus obtained againſt <hi>M. Alexander,</hi> bred ſuch ſpirit in <hi>M. Cook,</hi> and gained him ſuch applauſe and reputation, that he ſhortly after admitted himſelf of <hi>Grays</hi>-Inne, and within leſſe then three yeers, got a bare Gown upon his ſhoulders, and became a great Practiſer at Law, and afterwards fell in at Court, gained employment about the Fen-buſineſſe in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and recovering of Lands gained from the Sea in <hi>Norfolk</hi> and other Counties, for divers Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to whom his Majeſtie had granted his Right and demand thereunto, and was uſed in many Projects of like nature; gained a Patent of the Stewardſhip of the Kings Foreſts and Chaſes in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and thruſt out a far honeſter man then himſelf from that employment; got to be made a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace. And if this be that <hi>Cook</hi> that is mentioned in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, this muſt of neceſſity be that buſineſſe which he drived at; for <hi>M. Alexander</hi> profeſſeth he knoweth not of any other thing that ever hapned to him of like nature, in all his life; and concerning the carriage whereof, he leaveth himſelf to be judged accordingly. And thus <hi>M. Alexander</hi> hath been ſet, for the riſing of ſome; and his diſaſters have been the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Riſe of two great Lawyers, <hi>M. Fountain</hi> being one of them, now with his Majeſtie, acting againſt the Parliament; and the other, this <hi>M.

                  <p>Which Letter, you may perceive, was the Anſwer of a former Letter written by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> unto <hi>Nevil:</hi> Wherein be pleaſed for to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That <hi>Nevil</hi> anſwers a part of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſaid letter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Maſter <hi>Gay,</hi> which was the Examiner of the Court named in the Sentence, that took thoſe Depoſitions: And the truth is, that Maſter <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> having left this Depoſition with <hi>nevil</hi> to be examined with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, when he left the Town: He promiſed to do it, and to write Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> word thereof into the Countrey: Which he having for ſome time neglected to do, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> wrote unto him, to put him in minde thereof, and deſiring to be ſatisfied how it ſtood with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: In Anſwer whereof, he writes, that <hi>Maſter</hi> Gay <hi>is not in Town; but
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169298:46"/>ſo ſoon as he comes up, I will take a courſe with;</hi> which was, To examine the Depoſition with the Record; for at this time Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do with Maſter <hi>Gay;</hi> publication being paſt, and the copie of the Books taken out in the later end of <hi>Trinity</hi>-Term before: And when Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> afterwards came to <hi>London,</hi> Maſter <hi>Nevil</hi> then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers him the copie of the Depoſition, and ſays he had made it to agree with the Record, in manner and form as hath been formerly informed; and from that time, untill <hi>ſecundo Caroli</hi> that the Cauſe was heard, the Books were laid up, and never looked upon by Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> which was for above three yeers ſpace. And this is the very truth concerning this particular. And truely you may perceive by that which hath gone before, that albeit Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> did not go away for any ſuch reaſon that he had to fear the juſtneſſe of his Cauſe; yet if he had been tzed, as <hi>Laban</hi> did <hi>Jacob,</hi> to have fled away ſecretly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.27. he might well have anſwered, with <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Laban,</hi> he <hi>had just cauſe to be afraid.</hi> Truth it ſelf may ſometimes ſeek corners, not as fearing her cauſe, but as ſuſpecting her Judge; and therefore flight is not always an argument of guilt, but there onely where the perſon declines his Triall altogether: for after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence made by any perſon, to any Accuſation, in any Court of Juſtice, and that an Iſſue is joyned upon the proceedings, and the matter made ripe for hearing; now that the Court is thus poſſeſſed of the Cauſe, and have an ordinary way for to bring ſuch a matter unto judgement, the parties abſence cannot be ſaid to be a fleeing from juſtice; for now the Law will proceed notwithſtanding, and ſubject both his perſon and eſtate unto ſuch a Sentence, if there ſhall be found cauſe to order any thing againſt him; this being preſuppoſed, That, if poſſible, he may have notice of the day of hearing, to make his juſt Defence, that ſo he may not be ſurpriſed and overtaken unawares. Nor did the ſaid <hi>Nevil</hi> proſecute Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> for this offence; but was proſecuted by him foroffending as he did, as the proceedings manifeſt; unleſſe that his ſurpriſing him thus in his abſence, and without defence, may be called a proſecution, which was a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion rather.</p>

                  <p>Thus you ſee how malice ſtill purſued Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> at the heels, in all the latitude and extent thereof: Yet did that good God, who firſt took him into his protection, now raiſe him up friends again in his greateſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and extremities: And when now he was ready to be utterly undone, and ſwallowed up of his adverſaries, his Father in Law Maſter <hi>John Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors</hi> of <hi>Shelfanger</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> to whom he owes all the obſervation and duty of a ſon, and what ſhall ever reſt in him to expreſſe his thankfulneſſe, who beofre this time was diſſwaded againſt him, from doing any thing for him, by means of his adverſaries, who daily did inſtill into his ears rumours of ill behaviour, and of ſuch things as might ſettle him
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169298:49"/>in an ill opinion and belief of his converſation; thus at length perceiving that it was purpoſely done, that they might onely gain the better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deſtroy him; he now better looking into the buſineſſe then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which God onely moved his heart unto, found out, that it was a meer practice from the beginning utterly to undo him, without cauſe; and therefore, of his own goodneſſe, preſently did compound with the ſaid <hi>Fulwood</hi> for diſcharging and releaſing the ſaid Fine, and paid him, and took his Acquittance, and had the ſaid Letters Patents delivered to him; and paid and ſatisfied the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> and took his Acquittance, for the ſaid 130 <hi>l.</hi> coſts, and all other demands; and in like manner compounded with that unjuſt and evil man <hi>Henry Nevil,</hi> for the 50 <hi>l.</hi> given him in the ſaid Sentence for betraying his Client, and took his Releaſe alſo; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now that he had removed all impediments whatſoever, which did lie in the way of M. <hi>Alexanders</hi> preſerment in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being ſo far remote, and out of the eyes of thoſe that ſought his ruine and confuſion here: and when he had done all this, he ſent M. <hi>Alexander</hi> notice thereof. But this ſtorm was no ſooner thus blown over, but another cloud ariſeth, at firſt as little as a mans hand, which afterward covered all his Fortune again with blackneſſe, threatning a mighty ſhowre of deſtruction to follow, if not ſheltered from the violence of it. It was M. <hi>Alexanders</hi> good hap, by Gods aſſiſtance, and his good endeavours, to gain the good opinion of many Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others in that Kingdom, and by their countenance and employment, acquired much for the livelihood and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of himſelf and family, and was in a fair way of preferment and doing good for himſelf, his wife and children: which his enemies here no ſooner underſtanding, of purpoſe to blemiſh him, took occaſion to ſend over into <hi>Ireland</hi> many copies of the ſaid unjuſt Sentence, which they cauſed to be ſhewn to all Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> beſt friends and Clients there, to weaken him in their good eſteem, and divulged and publiſhed the ſame alſO unto all his enemies there: as, ſho can be a Practiſer at Law, and be juſt and faithfull to his Client, and zealous in their Cauſes, but ſhall and muſt have an ill report of the adverſe ſide, who will hugge ſuch an opportunity to do him miſchief? In all places alſo: they made it the ſubject of their diſcourſe, at Councel-Table, and in all the Courts of Juſtice, But amongſt the reſt, they made uſe of one Maſter <hi>Richard Fitz Gerald,</hi> as he is called; his fathers mothers Sirname I know not: But becauſe there are many Families of the <hi>Fitz-geralds</hi> in that Kingdom, to let you know the man I mean, he is Sir <hi>Dudly Loftus</hi> Knight his foſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brother, and was bred up with him a Boy at School, and maintained by Sir <hi>Dudleys</hi> father alſo, to wait upon his ſaid ſon in that time; by which he got ſo much learning, as afterwards he became Maſter <hi>Greenham</hi> an Attorneys Clerk in <hi>Ireland:</hi> and having the great fortune to marry with the ſiſter of a worthy gentleman, was promoted to be an Attorney in the Common-Pleas in <hi>Ireland:</hi> And aſpiring to attain yet to greater Offices in that Common-wealth, and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> having then purchaſed the Office of the Kings Bench there in <hi>Ireland,</hi> during the life of one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Henry Andrews</hi> the preſent Patentee, and Maſter <hi>Fitz-Geralds</hi> brother in law being alſo joyned Patentee with the ſaid Maſter <hi>Andrews,</hi> but had bound himſelf both by Articles of agreement and recognizance not to meddle with the ſame during Maſter <hi>Andrews</hi> his life: And Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:169298:49"/>having underſtood, that the way to riſe unto preferment, was to attempt ſomething againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander;</hi> whom if he could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, he was confident of the ſame good ſucceſſe to follow him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, as happened to Maſter <hi>Fountain</hi> and Maſter <hi>Cook</hi> the Lawyers, in thoſe brave atchievements which they accompliſhed againſt him, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid: And hereupon, that he might be made ſecundary of that Office with his brother, did undertake to out Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> thereof, and therefore firſt preferred a Bill of Complaint in his ſaid brother in laws name, in his Majeſties Court of Exchequer in <hi>ireland,</hi> againſt Maſter <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> and his Deputies, the effect whereof was, to gain the poſſeſſion and execution of the ſaid Office from Maſter <hi>Alexander;</hi> but upon ſuch ſlight and ſlender grounds, as there was neither law nor equity to warrant any ſuch Demand. Yet Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> well underſtanding the courſe of things in that Kingdom, and the alliances and dependence of one man unto another, and how far power and greatneſſe might poſſibly prevail to do him hurt; and perceiving the inclination of the Court of Exchequer there, where the Cauſe depended, to over-rule a Demurrer which he had cauſed his Deputies to put in for their and his defence in that Suit; made his repair over into <hi>England</hi> with the Proceedings, to be adviſed here by Counſel the beſt he could, for to maintain his juſt right and intereſt in the ſaid Office: But his departure was no ſooner underſtood, but the ſaid maſtere <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> poſts over after him into <hi>England,</hi> for <hi>London,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to have cauſed the remain of the ſaid Sentence to have been exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon him, and to have reſtrained him from making his return: He gained alſo letters of Credence and Recommendation, from Doctour <hi>Uſher</hi> Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others, to ſome Noble Perſonages and others here in <hi>England,</hi> to aſſiſt him in ſuch occaſions and buſineffe as he ſhould have then here to do: And being come to <hi>London,</hi> he made uſe of theſe generalls, againſt Maſtere <hi>Alexander</hi> in particular, contrary to the minde of thoſe from whom he received thoſe Letters: and firſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives a Writing, which he ſtiles, <hi>An Information againſt</hi> Jeromy Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>ſent out of</hi> Ireland <hi>the</hi> 12 <hi>of</hi> July, 1633. which he delivereth unto one Maſter <hi>Archibald Hamilton,</hi> that then was agent here for the ſaid Lord Primte of <hi>Ireland</hi> and others, and inſinuates unto him, that that thing was the buſineſſe which he came about, and had to do, and which was recommended unto him the ſaid <hi>Hamilton</hi> by the ſaid Letters of the Lord Primate to aſſiſt Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> in: Whereupon, Maſter <hi>Hamilton</hi> wnet unto Maſtere <hi>Alexanders</hi> old friends, the late Archbiſhip of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Laud,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> then Lord Keeper, and ſhewed them the ſaid paper, which was preſented unto his Majeſtie, with all the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions poſſible, to incenſe and cauſe his Highneſſe indignation and diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to continue, if not to wax more hot and fierce againſt him, inſomuch as his Majeſtie well knowing ſome of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> good friends at Court, who had often laboured with his Majeſtie in his behalf, informed them thereof, that for the time to come they might no more ſollicite for him: And in the interim, Maſtere <hi>Fitz-Gerald,</hi> or ſome other for him, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his earneſt ſollicitation, had procured a Warrant from the ſaid Lord keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> directed to the Warden of the Fleet, ſtrictly charging and commanding him to make diligent ſearch for Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and whereſoever, for to apprehend him, and reſtrain him in ſafe

                           <hi>IEromy Alexander</hi> an Utter-Barrester of <hi>Lincolns</hi>-Inne (being formerly an Attorney) was cenſured in the high Court of Star-Chamber, <hi>Mich. 2 Caroli,</hi> for a very foul offence, in falſifying copies of the Records of that Court, to the end he might miſlead the judgement of the ſaid Court against a perſon whom he proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                        <p>His Cenſure was, Firſt, to be utterly diſabled to practice as a Counſellour at Law, either publikely at the Bar, or privately in his Chamber. Secondly, to pay five hundred pounds Fine to his Majestie. Thirdly, to be committed to the priſon of the Fleet, and before his enlargement out of priſon, publikely at the Bar of the Star-Chamber (in humble and ſubmiſsive manner) to acknowlege his offence againſt God, and the Court, and ſhew himſelf ſorrowfull and penitent for the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pa hereupon, the ſaid <hi>Jeromy Alexander</hi> fled into <hi>Ireland</hi> to avoid the ſaid Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and there abides, and practiſes as a Counſellour, both publikely at the Bar, and privately at his Chamber, without obeying the ſaid Cenſure; in contempt of his Majeſtie, and of the high and honourable Court of Star-Chamber, to the great ſcandal of the Profeſſours of the ſame.</p>
                        <p>He hath lately obtained a Releaſe and Diſcharge under the Great Seal of that Kingdom for the ſaid Fine, and is now alſo endeavouring to procure his Pardon from the ſaid Cenſure, without making ſubmiſsion to his majestie, and the Court which cenſured him, and lives in <hi>Ireland</hi> very proudly and arrogantly, apt to fall into the like ſcandalous offence again upon any occaſion.</p>
                        <p>he endeavours to be Clerk of the Crown, and to be joynt Partner with Maſter <hi>Andrews</hi> the preſent Clerk, whereby the Records of that Court coming into his hands, he may do a world of miſchief, having ſo fine a trick of raiſing and falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Records.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is therefore earneſtly prayed, That the ſaid</hi> hiJeromy Alexander <hi>his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don may be ſtaid at the Great Seal there, untill he be tranſmitted by the lord Deputy of this Kingdom, to ſubmit himſelf to the ſaid Cenſure; or that otherewiſe there may be inſerted in the ſaid Pardon a Clauſe of Proviſo, that the ſaid</hi> Jeromy <hi>be not allowed to practiſe or bear any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in</hi> Ireland; <hi>whereby others may be deterred from committing the like offences hereafter; In regard of his conſtant perſiſting in foul pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, having thereby done prejudice already to ſome of the Nobility, and ſeverall of the Clergie, in this Kingdom: Of all which particulars good proof can be made from hence, by the ſeverall parties that have been injured by him.</hi>

                  <p>Thus you may perceive, that to reproach, is as eaſie as for to empty: But Chriſtianity is ſo much the better, that <hi>Nero</hi> reviles and perſecutes it: Yet ſee then the diſpoſition of the man, who conceived within himſelf, which
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:169298:50"/>he thus expreſſed, that the oppreſſions of men had taken away from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere <hi>Alexander</hi> that which was deſcended from his Anceſtours, and as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to him as the blood running in his veins; for he will be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive his Pedigree from Gentile Families, by both ſides of his Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours; which, if the height of ſpleen and rancour had not been in the Gentleman, he would have been aſhamed, if to have been accounted civil, to have left out amongſt the reſt: But diſgrace being the end he aimed at in it, ſought to improve that with the moſt advantage, and therefore as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate, in the next place he addes, <hi>Being formerly an Attorney;</hi> as if it were a ſhame for a man to attain a better Fortune from leſſe beginnings; and as if it had been a great diſparagement for to have learned the practick part of the Law the firſt, which, thoſe that better underſtand the ſtudie of it then himſelf, can inform the Gentleman, that it was his great miſtake, and that many famous and eminent Lawyers heretofore have been firſt Attorneys; inſomuch as in former times, he was not admitted to be of an innes of Court, that had not firſt been of an inne of Chancery, living amongſt Attorneyes, to underſtand the courſe of pleadings, and practice of the Courts of Juſtice; which to know beforehand, doth much advance a Student in his way, that he gains his Profeſſion with more eaſe, and falls into practice the better prepared for the advantage of his Client. But what you do obſerve in this his Information more concerning the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, is but rolling over the ſame ſtone again, of which you have well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the nature thereof before; and therefore to ſay no more of that, concerning the injuſtice of it: Yet hereby you may perceive the good will of the creature, that upon all occaſions had no other ſtaff to beat this dog withall. Albeit this Gentleman took upon him the boldneſſe to do more then any other before him had done, and to cauſe his Majeſtie to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that it was a high contempt in maſtere <hi>Alexander</hi> to uſe the profeſſion he had been bred up in, to acquire livelihood for to ſUpport himſelf and family, and all becauſe Maſtere <hi>Alexander</hi> had croſſed his expectation by it there in <hi>Ireland:</hi> But did S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> when by the Rulers, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Scribes they were commanded not to ſpeak at all, nor teach in the Names of JESUS, Did they forbear? What can b emore done to a man to take away his life, then his means of livelihood? and ſtarving to death, of all others, is ſaid to be the cruelleſt murther. But this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, your ſee alſo, had a high and great opinion of the dignity of that Court of Star-Chamber, which he ſtyles ſo high and honourable; which I believe that higheſt and moſt honourable Court of Parliament better underſtood then he, when they diſſolved it for the extreme oppreſſions and grievances it brought upon the people. He would have Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> practiſing alſo in <hi>Ireland</hi> too, to be to the great ſcandall of the Law, which he ſo little underſtood, as at the very firſt Bout he went about to deſile his own neſt, to diſgrace the Profeſſion of an Attorney, he being one him ſelf; but bred up therein, I muſt confeſſe, ſo far diſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more from theſe Schools of that myſterie, as I believe he was ignorant of the uſe and value which the law ſets upon a well-practiſed Clerk: ANd if it were ſuch a ſcandall for a lawyer to have been fined in that Court in thoſe days, as he doth preſſe it, (albeit, I muſt confeſſe) <hi>he that knows the will of his maſter and doth it not, is to be beaten with many ſtripes</hi>) yet they were not all Saints in that time that ſat upon the Bench; but were Judges
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:169298:51"/>under whoſe judgements many a good and innocent man ſuffered, and was ruined, beſides Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and of the ſame Profeſſion too; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Juſtice, where it meets with thoſe that are offenders in deed and truth, hath no reſpect of preſons, qualities, or conditions; but he that ſinneth muſt die, and without ſcandall to him that doeth well: And in thoſe days, who is't but doth know this Gentlemans ſo high and honourable a Court, as he calls it, was but a Stage or Theatre, wherein the politick Statiſts of that time acted the Tragedies of ſuch who would not comply with their evil Counſels, to have deſtroyed our Religion, Laws, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and ſubjected the Subject to a perpetuall ſlavery. You ſee alſo, it grieved M. <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> that M. <hi>Alexanders</hi> father in law had done ſo much for him, as to acquit him from all thoſe Vulture, which for the Fine and other moneys, would have divided his coat: But that which ſtuck in his ſtomack the moſt of all, was, that the feared Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould alſo procure his Pardon of all the reſt of the Sentence, without making ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Majeſtie, and the Court which cenſured him: though that were a little more then the Court had enjoynedto be done to his Majeſtie, yet ſee how by his good-will he would have intereſted his Majeſtie in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe more particularly, though not more then the Sentence, and all to unfold a myſterie which he, in his high conceit, apprehended was never underſtood before, by all thoſe <hi>Apollo</hi>'s and learned Judges of that Court, which, by his leave, were ſo well verſt, and underſtanding that matter, and the project they had in hand, as they beſt knew where the ſhoe wrang; and what they had done in it, was for another end then all the wiſedom he had could reach unto; and for his eyes, he was not ſo clear ſighted, as to look into a Milſtone further then they. But this was not all, for he ſaith further, Maſter <hi>Alexander lived in</hi> Ireland <hi>Very proudly and arrogantly, apt to fall into that ſcandalous offence again upon every occaſion.</hi> It ſhould ſeem by this, the Gentleman had a ſpirit of Propheſie, or was well verſt in Phiſiognomie, that he could by a mans countenance tell him his Fortune; or that he had ſome Raptures or Revelations that made him ſo cunning to foretell things to come: for ſurely, to the eyes of thoſe that lived there in converſation with Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſaw no ſuch appearance: and as for Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> own heart and conſcience, he found himſelf free from any ſuch inclination; and all the following ſtory of his life never yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared any ſuch matter. Then it muſt needs be, that ſpirit was in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets, which deceived him; which becauſe it were a ſhame for the Gentleman to confeſſe, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> is content that he be ſilent; although his experience hereof by this time ſheweth him his errour. But look a little further, <hi>&amp; hinc illae lachrimae:</hi> Maſter <hi>Alexander endeavoured to be Clerk of the Crown, and to be joynt Partner with Maſter</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews; for ſo he ſays; and here the ſhoe wrung him: and then this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans great hopes, firſt to be Secundary thereof to his brother in law, and in time to be maſter of the Office himſelf, would be at an end. The Proverb is, that <hi>Murther will out:</hi> He travelled till he was delivered: And I appeal herein, if theſe wilde Gourds ſpoiled not all the pot of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: <hi>Doloſus verſatur in univerſalibus:</hi> And whiles he kept his tongue within his teeth from relating particulars, to him that underſtood not the myſterie of the buſineſſe, would peradventure have approved his zeal, as if it had been for juſtice, upon one that never offended: But ſince his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169298:51"/>own intereſt appears now to be at ſtake, what indifferent man will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him in all the reſt. But, ſaith he, <hi>The Records of that Court coming to his hands, Maſter</hi> Alexander <hi>may do a world of miſchief, having ſo fine a trick of raiſing and falſifying of Records.</hi> Surely, if the man had been well in his wits, and not paſt ſhame, he would have bluſhed and trembled to have preſented ſuch an untruth unto any man, much more unto ſuch great Lords and Peers of the Kingdom; but moſt of all, unto a King: And I wonder when he perceived ſuch ſtrength of oppoſition to be againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> as he did, and with whom he practiſed, and thus joyned to ruine him; that if he had ever read the Statutes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> (which I dare ſay he will tell you he hath done all over, and all the Books of the Law beſides, and underſtands it far better then Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> (which for a quiet life, he will grant him to be ſo into the bargain, that he may yet be more conceited of his own worth, and unparallel'd abilities) but in ſuch caſe he muſt, I ſay, have found, that to raſe and falſifie a Record is Felony: And if Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had committed ſuch an act, the Court of Star-Chamber, by that Sentence, would never have troubled themſelves for to have ſtudied out means to have buried him alive, if they had had that neerer cut to have removed him out of the way: But on malice be it. And now if the Prayer of this Information be well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this will appear in its colours to all the world: <hi>It is prayed, That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Alexanders <hi>Pardon might be ſtayed at the Great Seal.</hi> Fond man! I ſee thou kneweſt not that the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> had ſolemnly vowed before, and profeſſed; that never any Pardon of this Sentence ſhould paſſe the Great Seal for Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> whiles he was Keeper of it; and he made but uſe of Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> in this kinde, to give a further colour for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: and yet, poor man, in he mean time, like the Fly that ſat upon the Axletree of the Cart, he verily thought it was he that raiſed all this duſt, which was the turning of the wheel: And he would have this Pardon ſtayed too, untill Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould be tranſmitted by the Lord Deputy of that Kingdom, to ſubmit himſelf unto the ſaid Cenſure, not knowing that in this time he had made Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> carry the Rod which was to have whipt his own tail; for had he prevailed to have had Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> attached here, he had inſtantly ſeiſed upon the Office, as wanting one to look over a place of ſuch eminency in the State, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Maſter <hi>Alexander;</hi> and having been once poſſeſſed thereof, neither his brother in law nor himſelf had ever lickt their lips after it, ſhould ever have been the better for it: And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> can aſſure him, that if he would have parted with his intereſt therein unto his Lordſhip the then Lord Deputy, as he was earneſtly dealt withall and treated with for that purpoſe, he was promiſed his Lordſhips great friendſhip into the bargain, and 100 <hi>l.</hi> more, ready down, then Maſter <hi>Fitz-Geralds</hi> brother in law gave him for it. Then to look a little further in this Information: If all this could not be obtained, then Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> would play at ſmall game, rather then to ſtand out; prayed, <hi>That there might be inſerted in the ſaid Pardon a Clauſe of Proviſo, that the ſaid</hi> Jeromy <hi>might not be allowed to practice or bear any Office in</hi> Ireland. You ſee how ſtill he pleaded for his own intereſt, and how maliciouſly he ſet himſelf to have deſtroyed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Jeromy;</hi> for now he thought him no longer worthy of his Sirname of <hi>Alexander:</hi> and indeed, having ungentleman'd him before, and taken
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169298:52"/>his Sirname from him now; ſo, if he might have had his will in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he would have left him without welt or guard, at the laſt: for if he could have prevailed that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould not have been admitted to uſe his Calling, neither in <hi>England</hi> nor <hi>Ireland,</hi> niether publikely or privately, nor to have born any Office, What courſe could he have then taken for a living? dig he could not, and to beg he was aſhamed; and what other way had been left him, whereby to have maintained himſelf and family? And this this worthy Gentleman would have done, to have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his Spleenatick humour. Yet, like the ſon of ſuch a father, he gives this reaſon for it; <hi>In regard,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of his conſtant perſisting in foul practice, having thereby done prejudice to ſome of the Nobility, and ſeverall of the Clergie in that Kingdom.</hi> You well know who was the father of ſuch untruths from the beginning: And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> is certainly perſwaded, that it was the invention of his own brain; for wrong he never did to any man in that or this Kingdom, nor in all the world, that he is conſcious of unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; nor did any man there, that was not of his Confederacy, ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the leaſt ill meaſure or miſcarriage done him by Maſter <hi>Alexander:</hi> And thoſe Complaints wherein he had a hand, albeit they had the ſaid Lord Deputies beſt countenance and aſſiſtance, and what he and all the enemies which he had could invent and put upon him; yet did Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> clear himſelf of whatſoever Accuſation, and left the ſhame to reſt upon them all, to whom it juſtly appertained. But peradventure Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> will anſwer this, in the language that he informed it in, and whatſoever his ill meaning was in the matter, will take the words in their proper ſenſe; and ſo tis true, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> by his Practice had done ſome of the Nobility and ſome of the Clergie prejudice: Sure it was his Profeſſion to do ſo, when he overthrew them in their unjuſt Suits, wherein he was of Counſel againſt them, yet did them no wrong therein, nor injury; unleſſe in Maſter <hi>Fitz-Geralds</hi> eſteem it was not fair for any man of Law to have opened his mouth againſt a Lord or Prelate of thoſe times: And for the Clergie, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> can but wonder that the ſhould make uſe of their names in ſo falſe a thing as this, when tis well known, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had no ſuch ill opinion amongſt the Clergie. And that you may perceive that Maſter <hi>Fitz-Gerald</hi> circumvented the Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in gaining this Letter from him under ſuch Generals, to do Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> a miſchief: the Information being ſent over to Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> by his friends at Court, to let him know how his Majeſtie was thus again poſſeſſed and incenſed againſt him; he went therewith unto the Lord Primate, and ſhewed his Lordſhip the ſame; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that his name was made uſe of, as one that ſent over this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt him; which he utterly diſclaimed; and, to go Maſter <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> right therein, gave him the Certificate under his hand, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in theſe words:</p>

And now after this, Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> father in law Maſter <hi>John Havers,</hi> and his uncle Captain <hi>Edward Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> being well ſatisfied by Counſel of the iniquity of the Sentence, and by Maſter <hi>Noy</hi> for one amongſt the reſt, out of their meer goodneſſe, could hold no longer, but were reſolved, That if the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> ſhould interpoſe in the matter any longer, againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> they would complain of him unto his Majeſtie: yet firſt they attempted again to obtain his Majeſties favour for a Pardon; which, with much ado, his Majeſtie granted; and for which, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> doth own very much to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who being well informed in the buſineſſe, and finding with what a high hand he was oppoſed by the Lord Keeper for his own ends, would not be denied of his Majeſtie therein; by which means it was obtained: Yet when it came to be drawn up, the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> came to the King again, and would have perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Majeſtie againſt it; but finding him and reſolved to have it done, when he perceived it muſt paſſe, yet then with his importunities he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed to have the Condition inſerted in it howſoever, That Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſhould not uſe his Profeſſion here in <hi>England:</hi> and after all this, yet ſtopt it at the Seal for ſome time, notwithſtanding, till Maſter <hi>Noy,</hi> being then this Majeſties Attorney-Generall, came to him of purpoſe, and told him reaſons why it were better for him to paſſe it ſo, then to endure a Complaint; and thereupon he ſealed it, much againſt his will; which fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>loweth in theſe words:</p>

                           <hi>EDward Havers,</hi> of <hi>Windfarding,</hi> in the County of <hi>Norfolk</hi> Eſquire, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth; That not long after the Petitioner <hi>Jerome Alexander</hi> was fined in the Star-chamber by that Sentence, againſt which hee now complaineth; this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent heing Uncle to his Wife, and underſtanding that the Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> late Lord Keeper, was an heavy enemy to the Petitioner in that buſineſſe, and deſiring to get him a Pardon of the Sentence, did endeavour, firſt to prevail with the ſaid Lord Keeper, that hee would not oppoſe the paſsing of the ſaid Pardon, in caſe the Petitioner could obtain it from His Majeſty; and to that purpoſe the Deponent made meanes to the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> by Sir <hi>John Hare</hi> Knight, the ſaid Lord Keepers ſonne in law, who laboured in it accordingly, as hee told this Deponent, and perſwaded the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> in the Petitioners behalf: But the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> as the ſaid Sir <hi>John Hare</hi> told this Deponent, would not bee perſwaded to it, but uſed theſe words to him, ſaying, Sonne, there ſhall never any Pardon paſſe the Seal for him, meaning the Petitioner, whiles I am Keeper of it: which for that time, put this Deponent out of all hope to obtain it; yet ſhortly after, the fine was begged, by one Maſter <hi>Fulwood,</hi> and paſſed under the great-Seal, who was compounded with for the ſaid Fine, and <hi>Nevil</hi> for his fifty pounds, and <hi>Yates</hi> for the Coſts. And when this Deponent attempted again to get a Pardon of the reſidue of the Cenſure, that ſo the Petitioner might have liberty to Practiſe, and uſed the Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> to move His Majeſty in the Petitioners behalf, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſaid Pardon, who did ſo; and the late Lord <hi>Faulkland</hi> alſo joyned in that Suit to His Majeſty for the Petitioner: But the Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> ſtill oppoſed it, albeit the ſaid Earl of <hi>Dorſet,</hi> begged it at the Princes birth, as a Boon from His Majeſty at that time; and ſo it reſted till His Majeſty went into <hi>Scotland;</hi> and there againe this Deponent petitioned His Majeſty at His Coronation there, for the ſaid Pardon, and procured the late Lord Treaſurer <hi>Weſton</hi> to move in it for the Petitioner: But His Majeſty remembring what the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> had informed him, againſt the Petitioner, notwithſtanding all the meanes that could be made, refuſed it. Yet after His Majeſties return from <hi>Scotland,</hi> this Deponent did again ſollicite His Majeſty by petition, in the name of the Petitioners father in law, this Deponents brother; and then again this Deponent procured the Earl Marſhall, and Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> Lord Chamberlain, to move in it for the Petitioner, who did ſo, and with great ſollicitation did obtain a Reference upon the Petition, and afterwards a Grant, that a Pardon ſhould paſſe: And then this Deponent laboured by Maſter <hi>Thankfull Fruen,</hi> the Lord <hi>Coventries</hi> ſervant, to perſwade his Lord, not to oppoſe it, who told this Deponent, that he did labour his Lord, the ſaid Lord <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventry,</hi> that he would ſuffer the Pardon to paſſe, who as Maſter <hi>Fruen</hi> told this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, did deny to yeeld to it, and ſaid to him again, It ſhould not paſſe the Seal, ſo long as he kept the great Seal, or words to that effect; and then as Maſter <hi>Fruen</hi>
                           <pb n="69" facs="tcp:169298:54"/>informed this Deponent, he told his ſaid Lord, that he would be commanded to doe it againſt his well, and therefore it were better his Lordſhip would do it willingly, but the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> would not be perſwaded by him, and at length Maſter <hi>Noy,</hi> then the Kings Atturney, perſwaded the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> to ſeal the Pardon, as this Deponent verily beleeveth: For this Deponent applying himſelf to the ſaid Maſter Noy, and telling him how the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> had before oppoſed it, and that he would oppoſe it: The ſaid Maſter <hi>Noy</hi> told this Deponent, that he would warrant this Deponent the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> would then be of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other minde: And the ſaid Maſter <hi>Noy</hi> being at the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventries</hi> at a Seal, when the Pardon was to be ſealed, did whiſper the ſaid Lord <hi>Coventry</hi> in his ear: and ſo at that time it was ſealed with that Condition, That the Petitioner ſhould not practiſe as a Counſellour at Law in <hi>England;</hi> as is contained in the Pardon.</p>

                  <p>And now after all this, a man would have thought that Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> ſhould have been at ſome reſt and quiet from further trouble in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: But afterwards it ſo fell out, as that he, being entruſted by the Earl Marſhall of <hi>England</hi> in the managing of a Suit which his Majeſtie had given him for ſuch Lands in <hi>Ireland</hi> as were his and his Ladies Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, and to which he could make out a good Title for the King: which when he had waded in ſo far, as that he had made it to appear unto the then Lord Deputy the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that a good Title would be found for his Majeſtie to a great quantity of Land which had ſometimes been the Inheritance of the Earls of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbury;</hi> covetouſneſſe, and ſomething elſe, now made him the ſaid Deputy to caſt an eye upon it for himſelf: and lying all not far from <hi>Dublin,</hi> within the Province of <hi>Leinſter,</hi> where the ſaid Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had gotten ſome footing before; firſt, his Lordſhip did labour with the Earl Marſhal to have quit his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence unto it, alleadging, that it would hinder his Majeſties deſignes of raiſing a Revenue in that Kingdom unto the Crown, and would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of differvice to the State; with other like Objections; with which he ſo prevailed, and with other Inſinuations, and promiſe of ſervice to the Earl Marſhal in other things, that he had almoſt perſwaded him to give over his Suit: And in the mean time the ſaid Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Letters from his Majeſtie, and iſſued out Commiſſions to entitle his Majeſtie to theſe Lands, as derived from the Earl Marſhals and his Ladies Anceſtours, which M. <hi>Alexander</hi> had diſcovered: And having found one Territory thereof, but not the tenth part thereof, afterwards procured more Letters for to paſſe the ſame to others at a ſmall Rent, under a hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> which was no leſſe in value then between three and four thouſand pounds <hi>per an.</hi> Which M. <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiving, informed the Earl Marſhal thereof, and of the true ſtate of things: Whereupon, his Lorſhip finding himſelf thus injured and abuſed by the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> did labour his Majeſtie that he might go on with his Suit for thoſe Lands, and did proceed ſo far, as that many of the <hi>terre</hi> Tenants, the ancient Natives, who had been in poſſeſſion by intruſions by them and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours for many Generations, ſome hundreds of yeers, Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had ſo ſatisfied them in the weakneſſe of their Titles, that, without
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169298:55"/>more ado, the chiefeſt of them began to ſurrender, and did ſurrender their eſtates into his Majeſties hands, with intent that they ſhould be granted to the ſaid Earl Marſhal and his Heirs, according to the Tenour of his Majeſties Letters in that behalf; and were reſolved to ſtand to the ſaid Earl Marſhals courteſie for new Grants to hold of him and his Heirs: Which thing when the ſaid Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> perceived, and that, the Earl Marſhal having gotten this footing, the ſaid Lord Deputies project therein concerning himſelf to get thoſe Lands, would be at an end; and ſo he was not onely like to have too powerfull a Neighbour, but his actions muſt thereupon be ſifted and diſcovered, in that wherein he had broken both truſt and all bonds of friendſhip with the Earl Marſhal, now he the ſaid Lord Deputy ſaw he had no other way to acquit himſelf, but either to gain Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> unto his party, or by cruſhing him altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that ſo he might be quitted of him; he therefore attempted firſt by all expreſſions of favour towards him, to win him; and at all places, and in all caſes, where he might ſhew him countenance, he did it, for a time, till he perceived that nothing could take him from his duty, or to violate the truſt the Earl Marſhal had put in him, but found that Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the rather proceeded with the more zeal and earneſtneſſe in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then before, and by this opportunity was able to have done the ſaid Lord Marſhals buſineſſe without him; when he thought twas high time to turn about, and that ſpeedily, or it had been too late; for all the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of thoſe Lands were reſolved to have made the like ſurrenders of their eſtates as their neighbours had done before, into his Majeſties hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereupon, ſpirits were raiſed up, to fined out other particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and claims of private men, which were ſet on foot againſt the ſaid ancient poſſeſſours; and albeit without colour or ſhadow of Title, yet it was enough to embroyl the buſineſſe, and for to hinder the Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals ſmoother proceedings: and now a Bill was firſt brought againſt theſe Gentlemen, for no other cauſe, but for making theſe Surrenders of their eſtates into the Kings hands; And becauſe it was pretended to be done in prejudice of thoſe claimers that had no colour of right; yet for this, and no other thing, were they grievouſly fined and cenſured in the Caſtle-Chamber there, for thus giving away their own Lands unto the King: and the Court of Wards, and all Courts there, were now filled with Suits againſt the Occupants, and their eſtates and poſſeſſions ordered from them, and they outed of their Intereſts, which they and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours had enjoyed for ſome hundreds of yeers before: and in this time they could get no Lawyer to plead or ſpeak for them, but Maſter <hi>Alexander;</hi> for which cauſe, the ſaid Lord Deputy had wrought all the Judges, ſome few excepted that were juſt men, to disfavour him, and fix whatſoever upon him to diſgrace him, when he came in their way; alſo, whomſoever he was that would complain againſt him, had the ſaid Lord Deputies ears open, and his creatures too more ready to receive, then any of them could poſſibly be for to petition againſt him: And thus Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had almoſt enough to do to make his own Defence againſt ſuch clamours and falſe things which were thus received againſt him, whereof he ſtill cleared and freed himſelf; but without any recompence of his loſſes and damages thereby ſuſtained, and without all repair for the baſe ſcandals were thereby put upon him: whereupon, he perceiving himſelf
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169298:55"/>thus reſolved and deſtined unto ruine, by ſome one means or other, were it right or wrong; and having underſtood out of his Lordſhips the ſaid Lord Deputies ſecret Cloſet, that he had aſſuredly purpoſed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ruine him; therefore, foreſeeing the danger, M. <hi>Alexander</hi> prepared, the beſt he could, for to prevent it: and now by the oppoſition that was between them, by which means thoſe that were in like manner oppreſſed did ſtill repair unto Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> for advice and counſel, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the moſt of his wicked actions; and obſerving his ways againſt others, and that there was no fence for him to ſave himſelf, whom he purpoſed for no deſtroy; therefore Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> and yet without his Paſſe, which was the thing he ſtormed at; having before this time made an Act of Common-Councell (which he declared ſhould in all tings be as binding as a Statute-Law) That no Subject of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhould come for <hi>England,</hi> or go elſewhere beyond the Seas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſpecial Licenſe: which when any endeavoured to obtain at his hands, againſt whom he had any thing to ſay, he muſt be ſure to ask and go without: howſoever, if he had no fair pretence; yet then it muſt be delayed at the leaſt, ſo long, untill ſome way or other was found out to obſtruct his paſſage; and ſo enthrall and trouble the Paſſenger, as ruine was the end at laſt, againſt whomſoever his diſpleaſure and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation did ariſe: And if it did ſo fall out at any time, that any man had obtained his Majeſties Letters to him, requiring his permiſſion to let him come for <hi>England,</hi> he would notwithſtanding hinder him, if he were ſuch a one as he had no minde to let depart, or whom he feared might tell tales at Court: therefore Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> procured the Warrant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for his repair into <hi>England,</hi> and made uſe of it for his coming away accordingly.</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> Am occaſioned, by His Majesties Letter of the first of <hi>October,</hi> underwritten by your ſelf, to deſire not onely my Lords of the Committee, but that the King alſo may underſtand how this Government hath been of late treated, nay ſlighted, in my Perſon; and that it may be there conſidered and directed, as it hath ſingly Relation to His Majesties Authority, and the Publike; not conceiving it at all otherwiſe to concern my own particular one way or other.</p>
                        <p>You may be pleaſed to remember how the Earl of <hi>Kildare</hi> lately went hence, and in what condition his Majestie ſent his Lordſhip unto us, together with a Command that an Information ſhould be put in againſt him in the Castle-Chamber, for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in departing the Kingdom without Licenſe: Nevertheleſſe, by His Majesties Direction, the proſecution hath hitherto been forborn, by reaſon of the ſenſe his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip expreſſed of his errour; and in hope, out of the apprehenſion of his own danger, he might be induced to yeeld his conſent, ſo to ſettle his eſtate, as might preſerve that ancient Family from the preſent Ruines his obſtinate and ill-ordered appetites will otherwiſe most aſſuredly and ſuddenly cover it withall.</p>
                        <p>But it ſeems this gentleneſſe and moderation wrought a quite other effect then was hoped, and rather emboldened, then in any degree reſtrained that humour of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, which good Gentlemen he believes ought and can onely expreſſe the greatneſſe and ſpirit of a <hi>Gerraldine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For not long after, in a Caſe depending betwixt the Earl and the Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> his Lordſhip found ſtomack to deny bringing in of certain Writings concerning the Castle of <hi>Leigh,</hi> whereunto his Lordſhip is obliged, by the Award of King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed Memory; and perſiſting in his contempt, was, about ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths ſince (and ſo continues ſtill) committed by Order of the Deputy and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</p>
                        <p>A moneth agone, or thereabouts, I ſent my Secretary to acquaint his Lordſhip I underſtood the Counteſſe his Lady had been all the night before at the Rings end, waiting upon a paſſage for <hi>England;</hi> but the winde turning croſſe, had conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Ladiſhip to her lodging again: Thus as a friend I wiſhed his Lordſhip to call to minde the manner of his Lordſhips last going over, and coming back; that I was unwilling my Lady ſhould meet with any diſpleaſure or trouble, on the other ſide: and therefore, if I might underſtand what number of ſervants, Coach-horſes, or any other accommodations ſhe deſired for her journey, I would inſtantly ſend her Ladiſhip my Licenſe for them all.</p>
                        <p>The Anſwer his Lordſhip ſent me, was, His wife went againſt his will; that he would be glad I ſtaid her: And the next I heard, her Ladiſhip was landed at <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> rid by Poſt-horſes thorow <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and ſo by Coach to <hi>London.</hi>

                        <p>And howſoever, as under favour, I judge it not becoming any Subject, how great ſoever he either is, or takes himſelf to be, thus, out of animoſity or wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not to content himſelf to do his buſineſſe, without he may alſo pleaſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie himſelf, through a preterition and ſcorn put upon us his Majeſties ordinary Miniſters, and the Government it ſelf: So is it altogether intolerable, when men of mean and defamed condition ſhall flatter and blowe themſelves up to a like vanity and preſumption.</p>
                        <p>And yet ſuch a one there is, by name Maſter <hi>Jerome Alexander,</hi> a Counſellour at Law, who, by untrue ſurmiſes, I conceive, to my Lord Marſhal, hath procured the Letter I firſt mentioned, under the Signet, That, as of a perſon of whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and employment his Lordſhip hath eſpeciall occaſion, I muſt declare and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie unto this Gentleman, that it is His Majeſties will and pleaſure that he do with all convenient ſpeed make his repair thither; am required not to ſuffer any impediment to hinder his coming, and likewiſe to take courſe that in his abſence he may not receive any loſſe or damage by any Proſecution againſt his perſon or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.</p>
                        <p>Indeed I ſomething wonder the Gentleman ſhould do in this manner, having never had from me in his life, either in the courſe of his Practice, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, other then courteous and reſpective uſage; and which I take unkindly from him, I confeſſe, thus to inſinuate with my Lord Marſhal, before he had ever acquainted me with his occaſions, or deſire of going over, as if I ſhould be againſt his departure for his Lordſhips ſervice, unto whoſe Affairs I have been underſtood to wiſh as much proſperity, as any other poor ſervant his Lordſhip hath: nay, ſo evident a truth is this, as His Majeſtie, I am moſt confident, will graciouſly remember it to have been verily ſo, in more particulars then one.</p>
                        <p>I may therefore ſincerely affirm, that if Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had deſired, in his own name, much more for my Lord Marſhal his occaſions, to have had Licenſe, it ſhould have been as ſoon granted as moved: What need was there then for him thus to ſeek it, in this implicite and braving manner, as if it were to be whether I would or no, before ever I were asked the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion? And yet let me inſtruct him, pleaſe or raiſe himſelf never ſo high by theſe little Aſſumptions, they will not much value him, with wiſe men, for all that.</p>
                        <p>Next, I muſt confeſſe, I am not well pleaſed he ſhould wrap me under the like Guilt of Diſobedience with himſelf, by not admitting me ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite as to do my Maſters will, and to declare and ſignifie unto him the Kings pleaſure, according as I was directed: For whereas upon the receipt of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſaid Letters, and being informed from the Bearer of Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> abode in the Countrey; my Anſwer was, That at his coming to Town the buſineſſe ſhould be diſpatched.</p>
                        <p>After I have certified you very truely, the Letter came not to my hands before the ſixth of this Moneth, and that he was ſeen in <hi>London</hi> the ninth of the ſame, it will eaſily and plainly be gathered, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was gone before he vouchſafed ſo much as to deliver me the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And yet I attribute it rather to height of minde and ſtomack, then to his over-dilgence, thus firſt and laſt to over-run the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                        <p>Again, out of my Duty to the orderly and comely proceeding of theſe Affairs, admit me to obſerve the ill conſequence I fear must follow ſuch an ill Inſtance
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169298:57"/>as this, as well in the generall, as in this particular: In the generall, we ſhall be ſure to have Suiters enough in this kinde, if that they may thus procure, not onely leave to go over, but Protections Royall alſo, which may free them not onely from the Civil demands of the Subject, but from any Criminall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution againſt them, on His Majeſties behalf; and not onely ſo, but that the Kings Deputy muſt be enjoyned to take courſe for every private mans buſineſſe, that hath, or may have enough of his Majesties to attend beſides: And in this particular, I know not how it might be thought His Majeſtie had been informed, to give ſuch an eſpeciall and gracious Protection to a perſon that was but a few yeers ſince publikely ſentenced and branded for a foul and corrupt Forgery, in the Starre-Chamber of <hi>England;</hi> So as it is truely to be wiſhed, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman may prove more faithfull to his Lordſhips commands and ſervices here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, then in thoſe times it ſeems he was, either to his own conſcience or credit.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, give me leave to acquit my ſelf, upon this occaſion, of a ſeverity imputed unto me, by the ignorance and malice of ſome, as if this reſtraining of mens going over without Licence, were a new-found holy-day of mine own, and firſt introduced by me, then which, God wot, nothing more groſly miſtaken; for it is most plain, that by the ancient Law I was penally impoſed upon this ſubject, which appears by the Statute in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of <hi>25</hi> of <hi>H. 6. cap. 2 and 9.</hi> which reciting, That hereafter no Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Lands ſhould be ſeiſed, though out of the Land, if ſo be it were by the Command of the King his Lieutenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> implies, That before that time if they had gone, of their own heads, their Lands were then, and ſtill are to be ſeiſed into the Kings hands.</p>
                        <p>Next, in reaſon of State and Government, it hath always been ſo declared and practiſed by many Acts of State, and all the Governours ſucceſsively; it being in truth moſt dangerous to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> That this ſubject, ſo much addicted to hold Intelligence and forraign dependances abroad, ſhould have liberty to be tranſported as they liſt, without giving any account at all of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the preſent Governour.</p>
                        <p>And in the laſt place, as a matter much conducing to the good and quiet of this Kingdom, they themſelves, in their twelfth Article of Graces, beſeech the King it may be ſo continued: And his Majestie, by his Princely Anſwer, aſſents, and enjoyns it to be ſo practiſed and obſerved. So as after all this, there muſt be many better tokens then any as yet I have heard, before the childe can, by any interepretation, be taken or believed to be mine.</p>
                        <p>And thus, in all humility, I ſubmit the conſideration hereof to his Majeſties wiſedom, beſt able to diſcern an inconvenience, and ſeaſonably to apply the proper remedy, reſting,</p>

And well it was for Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> that he was ſo impriſoned; for though it was conceived too much puniſhment for ſo ſmall an offence, yet it ſtopped the Earl of <hi>Straffords</hi> mouth from all further complaint againſt him; or otherwiſe he would never have left, till he had gotten him to have been ſent over back again for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and left unto his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                        <p>HUmbly ſhewing, That in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, in the ſecond yeer of His Majeſties Reign, your petitioner brought a Cauſe to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he was Plaintiff, againſt one <hi>John Yates,</hi> and others Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants in His Majeſties Court of Star-Chamber; for Perjury, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Perjury, Imbracery, terrifying of Witneſſes, and other like foul offences, and miſdemeanors, in the ſaid Bill of Complaint appearing.</p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:169298:60"/>
                        <p>At which hearing the Depoſition of one <hi>John Warren,</hi> taken in the Proceed of that Suite, was read againſt the aid <hi>Yates,</hi> to convince him of the terrifying of Witneſſes onely; and upon reading of another Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one <hi>Robert Warren</hi> Clerk to that point, the Court was ſatisfied of the guilt of the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> of that offence, and thereupon pronounced a ſentence againſt him for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>And as to the other charges of the ſaid <hi>Bill,</hi> nothing was read or enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for the Perjuror being dead before the hearing, though the Perjury and Subordination were fully proved within the Books, yet for that Cauſe, did not your Suppliants Counſell preſſe any Teſtimony to enforce that accuſation of Subordination againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates;</hi> which was indeed the main thing, whereof your petitioner complained in his Bill.</p>
                        <p>And your petitioner ſaith, That a ſentence being pronounced againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> as aforeſaid, and the Court then proceeding to other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, your petitioner departed; and afterwards, when the Lords were riſen, whileſt yet they were in the inner Star-Chamber, the then Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> Lord-Keeper, was enformed, That in the Paper Copy of the ſaid <hi>John Warrens</hi> Depoſition, the word, <hi>viz.</hi> (that and did) were ſtricken out with a Pen, in the ſaid Copy, and not read in the ſaid Depoſition at that hearing; which as it was informed, altered the ſence of the Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made it to be poſitive and direct, which otherwiſe was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uncertain: And then, that the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> ſtood convicted but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſingle Teſtimony; whereupon, the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> was inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and diſmiſſed with an 130 l. coſts, adwarded againſt your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, or thereabouts.</p>
                        <p>This Oblituration of the ſaid words was obſerved at the hearing of the Cauſe, in the hands of one <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> your petitioners Solicitour in that Court, when he read the Depoſition; but then was not informed to the Court, which had been the proper time, but was omitted of purpoſe, as your petitioner conceiveth; That afterwards your petitioner might not enforce any other Teſtimony, or matter (which he then might, and could have done) ſufficient to have convicted the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> guilty of the ſaid offence, and for to have cleered your petitioner from that accuſation, as that a buſineſſe might be made of it, to ruine and undo your petitioner, as the ſequell proved.</p>
                        <p>And it being obſerved, that the Lord <hi>Coventrey,</hi> late Lord-Keeper, then appeared therein againſt your petitioner, he could not afterwards procure his Counſell further to preſſe any thing againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates,</hi> to maintain that Charge, and continue the Sentence againſt him pronounced, or that might clear your petitioner from the ſaid offence and accuſation.</p>
                        <p>And the ſame being called into queſtion and examination, albeit your petitioner did thereof ſufficiently purge himſelf upon his Oath, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and did truely lay the fault, where the blame ought to lie, upon the ſaid <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> who was the doer of the Fact; and albeit, nothing was, or oculd be proved, or made to appear againſt your petitioner to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of that he made to appear, for clearing of himſelf; yet the ſaid <hi>Nevill</hi> being a Member of that Court, and therefore favoured all that might be poſſible, the matter was ſo carried, that in your petitioners ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence out of Town about his neceſſary affairs, the ſame was made the onely proof of his guiltineſſe, which being endeavoured to be fortified
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169298:61"/>with ſeverall meer Inferences and Suppoſitions, and miſtaken Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from your petitioners countenance, and ſuppoſed perſonall behaviour in the carriage of himſelf, preſſed beyond all indifferent interpretation, and the truth it ſelf; and upon ſome other extrajudiciall matter enforced alſo againſt your petitioner without any ground, and againſt the Forms and Rules of the ordinary proceedings of that Court, a concluſion was drawn from theſe falſe premiſſes, to charge your petitioner with that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and thus your petitioner was fined to his Matie in 500 l. and 50 l. was adwarded againſt your petitioner, to the ſaid <hi>Nevill</hi> for dammages; and your petitioner was further adjudged, never to uſe again his Profeſſion and Practice of an Utter-Barriſter at Law, eitehr publikely at the Bar, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in his Chamber, and to remain committed to the priſon of the <hi>Fleet:</hi> And before your petitioners enlargement, it was further adjudged, That your petitioner muſt at the Bar of the ſaid Court, in humble and ſubmiſſive manner, acknowledge the ſame to be his offence (whereof he was innocent) againſt God and the Court, and to ſhew himſelf very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and ſorrowfull for the ſame; and withall, was left and declared to the Society of <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> whereof he was a Member, as unworthy to live in the Society; who thereupon was expelled the houſe, his Chamber ſeized and diſpoſed of: And thus in an inſtant of time, your petitioner was made more miſerable, then if he had never been born.</p>
                        <p>And all this done (with ſo high a hand) that by this means your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner might be utterly deprived of all ſupport, and diſabled ever to look up into the World again, either to ſeek for help or relief, againſT this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, or to maintain himſelf and Family, by any courſe of life, to which he had been bred. Which when your petitioner underſtood, and not before, he was enforced then to leave his Countrey, his Wife, Children, Friends, and Profeſſion too, which he had acquired with the expence of his whole Patrimony, and the whole Study of his life then before.</p>
                        <p>Nor had your petitioner (being thus exiled) ſetled himſelf for any long time; but the malice of his adverſaries ſo vehemently purſued after him, That the ſaid Fine was begged of His Majeſty, and paſſed under the Great Seal, to hinder any poſſible Inſtallments or Compoſition for the ſame, but what they Grantee thereof pleaſed.</p>
                        <p>And further, to foreſtall your petitioner by any addreſſes to be made to His Sacred Majeſty, for pardon of the reſidue of the ſaid Cenſure, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the onely way then left unto your petitioner (till this happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) to gain your petitioner ſo much as a Being in the World, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being ſo ſtrongely informed by the late Lord <hi>Coventry,</hi> Lord-Keeper, and others, againſt your petitioner, for this onely Cauſe inforced to be ſo Capitall, That your petitioner was not a man worthy, or fit for His Majeſties Mercy; yet your petitioners Friends, out of meer Charity and Commiſeration of your petitioners deplorable Eſtate, diſcharged the ſaid Fine of 500 l. to the Grantee, and the ſaid 50 l. to the ſaid <hi>Nevill,</hi> and the ſaid 130 l. to the ſaid <hi>Yates;</hi> and yet your petitioner for this fifteen yeers now laſt paſt, or thereabouts, hath thus been debarred the uſe of his Calling and Profeſſion in this His Majeſties Realm.</p>
                        <p>And now humbly beſeecheth this Honourable Aſſembly, to take the ſame Sentence into conſideration, and to review and reverſe the ſame, and

                  <p>But the great and publique Affairs of the Kingdom encreaſing and growing every day more and more; albeit, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> did labour all the wayes, and friends he had, for to have gotten his ſaid Cauſe to have been heard, yet could not procure it: So that after almoſt a yeers attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance about it, with no effect, he was enforced to forbear the further ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of it for a time, and made his repair over unto his Eſtate and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from which he had been abſent above four yeers and a half before, conſtrained by the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> as aforeſaid, where he had not continued above five weeks ſpace, or little more, but thta horrid Rebellion there brake forth, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> being then in the County of <hi>Meath,</hi> not aboe 24. Miles diſtant from the City of <hi>Dublin</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, and within the <hi>Pale,</hi> little ſulſpecting any ſuch danger; and whereas the Tragedy ſhould have been acted at <hi>Dublin</hi> the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. Which bleſſed be that good God, which ſo miraculouſly prevented it, upon the 24. day of <hi>October,</hi> 1641. There was an attempt made upon Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> to have ſurpriſed him, his wife, and family, which had aſſuredly been his deſtruction, and was the immediate finger of God that preſerved them: And albeit, he eſcaped with his wife and family, the moſt of them with their perſons; yet did the ſaid Rebels, both there, and in other places of that Kingdom, then inſtantly ſeize upon a perſonall Eſtate of his in Goods, Chattels, and Cattells, to the value of 6000 l. or thereabouts, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a reall Eſtate of his in Lands, which yeelded him above 1000 l. <hi>per anaum,</hi> all which they ſhared and devided amongſt them, and do poſſeſſe to this day.</p>
                  <p>Thus then you may perceive into what ſad a condition and diſtreſſe Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was brought again upon a ſudden, being diſpoiled of his whole Eſtate and Fortune; and by reaſon of the troubles, both here and there, out of all hope or expectation any way to acquire any lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and ſubſiſtance for himſelf, his wife, children, and family; yet in this great ſtraight, choſe rather to come for <hi>England,</hi> then to remain there, where he perceived he could neither do good for himſelf, or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; and being come over, that good God who hath hitherto never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him in his greateſt troubles, did ſo move the hearts of his friends, and acquaintance, that they gave preſent ſupply unto his neceſſities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond whatſoever he did imagine, or could expect: And now if he would have remained with them in the Countrey, might have had a competent proviſion made for him and his family, by his friends; which to have embraced, he ſhould have lived much more free and ſafe from danger, then he hath done ſince; but he was perſwaded by ſome of the worthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Commons now deceaſed, rather to ſettle here in this City of <hi>London,</hi> to whom they privately engaged themſelves, in ſuch caſe, that he ſhould not want for ſufficient maintenance, and reſting thereupon ſtayed, and hath now for this three yeers ſpace, and more, continued here; and with his utmoſt diligence and abilities, faithfully, and conſtantly, hath ſerved the Parliament in ſuch commands as they have been pleaſed to enjoyn him; and of which, he doubteth not, but all thoſe with whom he hath had to do, but will give teſtimony of his carriage, and the good demeanour of himſelf therein, accordingly; yet ſuch hath been his unhappineſſe, ſtill to meet with perſons ill affected to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and maligning him, even in thoſe ſervices which hath no way
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169298:63"/>conſcerned his particular; but for his promoting the publike, with more zeal and candour then ſufficient (for he calleth God to Witneſſe) that to the beſt of his underſtanding, he hath not done anything to the prejudice of the Parliament in the leaſt, or with any by-end or ſiniſter reſpect for his own private, but with ſingleneſſe of heart, and a good conſcience to this day, hath laboured to approve himſelf juſt and fair in all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, both before God and man; and he cannot help it, if thoſe that have ſought themſelves, and peradventure, have miſſed their ends by his more watchfulneſſe in thoſe wayes, and things, wherewith he hath been intruſted: If ſome ſuch as theſe men, have aſperſed him behinde his back, for his labour, with falfe and ſcandalous reports, and otherwife have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, for to deſtroy and ruine him, which he ſhall let you ſee have therefore done it, not that if they could herein have accompliſhed their deſires, it could any wayes have advantaged the common cauſe, but onely to have removed an impediment out of their way, which was too quick ſighted perhaps, to let thoſe things paſſe unſeen and undiſcovered: And therefore no ſooner was he obſerved to be imployed in any thing, that was Parliamentary, but the malice of his enemies began afreſh to diſplay it ſelf; and now they laboured with all thoſe with whom he had to do, to poſſeſſe them with an evill opinion of him; ſometimes affirming, that he was a Papiſt, and held correſpondence with Papiſts, intimating the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> to the ſuch a one; and alleadging, that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> held continuall Intelligences with him beyond the Seas, and with his Son in the Kings quarters: And albeit, Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> conceives his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and Son, not to be of that Religion; and that it had been no offence to have written unto his Lordſhip, the ſaid Earl, or any attending upon him, of ſuch things as were no wayes prejudiciall unto the State: And albeit, you may well perceive, by that which hath been ſaid before, That Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Friends, and Kinred on both ſides, have had Relation to that Noble Familie, and dependance upon them for ſome Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations; and that he hath in his own particular, been imployed in his Lordſhips bufineſſe, and to have received many favours from him, and diſaſters for his occaſions; and therefore, that it were an Act of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> not to ſerve his Lordſhip and Family, in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and juſt Commands; yet was it a thing never ſo much as deſired by them, or any about them, to imploy him in any thing concerning their Affairs, ſince the unhappy troubles here begun, nor hath he ever received Letter from them, nor written Letter to them, nor any about them, ſince they left the Parliament; either into parts beyond the Seas, or into the Kings quarters: Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> being well underſtood to be of another judgement, which he hopeth he hath manifeſted by his converſation, and endeavours in the Service of the Parliament: he hath otherwiſe been taxed to have held correſpondence with Rebels in <hi>Ireland,</hi> (and under that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall) ſome have defamed him behinde his back, to have held correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Marqueſſe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> and that he ſent him a 1000 l. which all that knows Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> as it is now with him, he was farre unable to do: And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath been committed into cuſtody of the Serjeant at Arms, of the Houſe of Commons, as by the Order following may appear.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169298:65"/>leave and forſake this City, if to have been afraid of his own ſhaddow; it was declared unto him, That he was accuſed ſtrongly by ſome at a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meeting, for doing ill offices between the Parliament and City of <hi>London,</hi> wherein he was charged to have done that which he could but anſwer with his life; and that he was alſo voted by a Committee, for to be again committed to the Serjeant at Arms of the Houſe of Commons, which was ſo ordered as it was related; and if the Serjeant at Arms would have adentured to have taken Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> into cuſtody again, upon an Order made by thoſe who had no power of commitment, he had been certainly impriſoned the ſecond time, and upon like ground as before; but when the miſtake was better underſtood, or at leaſt the end thereof failing, and being diſappointed, and Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> therefore walking ſtill at large, the further purſuite of that Order ceaſed: But not long afterwards a new device was ſet on foot again for to inthrall him: And thus it was, Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> wife having borrowed ſome Houſhold-ſtuff of one of her Kinſwomen, here in Town, wherewith to furniſh him a houſe, was conſtrained to bring the ſame into her houſe when ſhe could have it, in the Winter time, about ſix a clock in the morning, and ſix at night, which was colour enough to pick a quarrell at this proceeding, and to give out, That theſe Goods were belonging to Malignants, and that there was much Plate amongſt them of great value: Under which pretence and ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for ſome other prerence, one day when Maſt. <hi>Alexander</hi> was known to be abſent from home, one Maſter <hi>Maurice Gethin,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Tempaſt Milner,</hi> Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> were dealt withall by ſome of Maſter <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi> enemies, by colour of an Ordinance which they had obtained of the 16. of <hi>October,</hi> 1643. to ſeize upon (Papiſts, Delinquents, or Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants Eſtates, ſeizable) to come to the houſe where Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was lodged in <hi>Loathbury</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and to enter the ſame, and under pretence to ſearch for ſuch Goods of Deliquents, Papiſts, and Malignants, to ſeize and poſſeſſe all Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Papers, and Writings whatſoever, which they could finde: And the ſaid Maſter <hi>Gethin,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Milner,</hi> with ten Perſons more at the leaſt in their Company, and whom they had hired for that purpoſe, on or about the of 1643. having watched their opportunity, when Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was from home as aforeſaid, they forcibly entered into his houſe, and ſet a ſtrict watch and ward round about it, not ſuffering any body to go in or out, till they had effected what they came for; they alſo in an inſtant entered ſeverally into every Room of the houſe at once, there being none of his Family within doors, when they came in, but Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> wife, whom they thus very much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and affrighted: And albeit, ſhe deſired to ſee by what Warrant they did it, telling them they were miſtaken, and that her husband was no ſuch man, as to have his houſe entered after that manner, for a Papiſt, Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or Delin quent; yet would they not ſhew her by what authority they ſo came thither: but with ſuch Inſtruments as they brought with them, forced, and broke open Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Studdy doors, Desks, Cheſts, Truncks, and Cabinets, in the ſeverall Rooms at one time, and ſearched and ranſacked all of them, and every Room and corner of the houſe; Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toried all his Goods, and ſeized upon every writing, and peece of Paper, that they found in the houſe, bound them up, and carried them out of his houſe, towards, <hi>Cambden</hi> houſe; and as they were carrying away, Maſter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169298:65"/>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> by chance coming home, met the ſame upon a Porters back; and all the favour he could obtain at their hands, was to go along with them unto <hi>Cambden</hi> Houſe, where they were laid up untill they were viewed and ſeen by them, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Milner</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gethin,</hi> and much ado Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> had at firſt to perſwade ſo much favour, as to have them viewed over in his preſence, and it was a good time before he could prevail with them unto that, ſaying that it might be others might have the ſight of them the firſt, and they did take adviſe aſſuredly of their ſetters on, before they would be drawn to view them; and after they had viewed and peruſed them, and found nothing that anſwered their expectation, Maſt. <hi>Alexander</hi> had his writings delivered him back again with much ado, and was inforced to cleer the property of his goods by oath; and if it had not been his good fortune ſo opportunely, for to have met with the Porter carrying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ad they were going out of his houſe, he is certainly perſwaded they had been all carried to the uttereſt enemies which he had; which he had not cared for, (if ſo they had not delivered back more then were taken from him) and ſo poſſibly might have made ſomething of nothing: And albeit Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> deſired from them, to ſee by what power he was thus uſed, or abuſed rather, they told him they had a Warrant by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Parliament to do it, but ſhewed him none; to which he ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, notwithſtanding upon their words; and thus Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> had his Goods, rifled and ſpoiled, and ſome of them loſt and imbezelled, and what Papers, or other things amongſt ſo many as they poſſeſſed, are kept back from him, it is not poſſible for him to miſſe at preſent. That the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> himſelf never delt worſe with any man in this nature; thus to force, and break open all his doors, Truncks, Locks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without ſo much as ever ſpeaking with him before hand, and well knowing Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to be a man well affected to the Parliament, and imployed daily in their ſervice; and this done without any authority at all: For their ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, though it be of a very large extent, yet it extends no further, but that they the ſaid Maſter <hi>Gethin, &amp;c.</hi> or any one of them aſſiſted with one of the Committee of Sequeſtrations, ſhall have power and authority to procure to be inventoried and ſecured to be forth coming, any Money, Plate, Jewels, Goods, Chattels, and perſonal Eſtate, in the Cuſtody of, or to any Papiſts, Delinquents, or Malignants, whoſe Eſtates are ſeizable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was not in the compaſſe of this power; was yet never Papiſt, Delinquent, or Malignant; howſoever he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that they had any colour to take away writings and evidences, nor thus to deal with him, when they were informed what he was, yet thus hath he been dealt withall; and when he deſired from them, but to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed who were their ſetters on; their anſwers were (that if they had not done it, others would) whoſe names they would not diſcover for a 100 l. all which alſo, he hath hitherto indured with patience.</p>
                  <p>And it was not long after, that becauſe he was ſo much favoured of ſome of his friends, in commiſeration to him, having loſt his whole eſtate by the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland.</hi> That he had his dwelling given him there in a manner <hi>gratis,</hi> that upon an inſtant, he was inforced to remove and leave the place, to ſatisfie the deſires to ſome that thought it too much charity for him to enjoy ſuch relief, when others that have leſſe need, want it not, and enjoy what their hearts can wiſh.</p>
                  <p>All this not yet working that effect, ſo eagerly purſued after to deſtroy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169298:66"/>him, and it being underſtood that Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> had obtained the favour and good opinion of many worthy Lords, and others of the Scotiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And it being feared by his Purſuers leaſt it might turn to ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or other matter, which might advance him further in their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; therefore ſcandalized and traduced him to them behinde his back, and laboured to be made as odious, as if he were a monſter, and a man not worthy of their acquaintance; inſomuch, that it could not be withholden to be told ſome of them, that matters of their publike Affairs did receive prejudice by him, and would not receive diſpatch, untill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge had been had of that Knave <hi>Alexander,</hi> giving him that Livery, and uſing that expreſſion of him, which he hath paſſed by in ſilence too, amongſt the reſt.</p>
                  <p>But malice hath no end, but in the ruine of its object, or of it ſelf, he hath eſcapt our fingers, ſayes ſome afterwards, twice already, but if he doth it the third time, he ſhall have good luck, and then again was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented upon the ſuppoſition of high contempts, which ended in ſmoak. and vaniſhed; a threatned man lives long: And thus when the innocent are miniſhed, and brought low, ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> through oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, through any plague or trouble, though God ſuffers them to be evilly entreated through Tyrants, and let them wander out of the way in the Wilderneſſe; yet helpeth he the poor out of miſery, and maketh him Houſholds like a Flock of Sheep; the righteous ſhall conſider this and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and the mouth of all wickedneſſe ſhall be ſtopped; who ſo is wiſe will ponder theſe things, and they ſhall underſtand the loving kindeneſſe of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 39, 40, 41, 42, 43.</p>
                  <p>But this yet reſted not here; he muſt be exaſperated and provoked fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to impatience, to gain advantages if poſſible againſt him, whereby to enthrall and trouble him; and having a publike imployment to attend, he is there reviled with uncivill and approbrious ſpeeches, and hath the lie given him, but for telling the truth, and was termed a baſe Fellow to his face, of him that was ſo indeed, (and by a perſon of far inferiour rank and quality to him himſelf) and all to have ſtirred him up to that which hath been heretofore accompted the reward of ſuch fowl language; nay he had his Desk with all his Money and Papers in it, in his abſence taken out of the Office where he waited, without any cauſe or provocation given; but the intent was the ſame of Mr. <hi>Milners,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gethins,</hi> thinking to have made mighty diſcoveries of Correſpondencies holden with perſons ill affected to the Parliament; and do you not think that ſuch a burnt childe as this, hath need to dread the fire; to be very wary and watchfull over his wayes: But to proceed, When all theſe things would not ſerve the turn, nor any other aſperſions unjuſtly caſt upon him, almoſt every day at pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private meetings in Parliament, in the City, and every where, to make him odious, not onely to his friends and acquaintance, but to all good men that ſhould come but to hear of him, then <hi>(Canis ad vemisum)</hi> this old cenſure is again revived to blanch him now in the opinion of thoſe with whom he had to do, both in publike buſineſſes, and concerning his own particular; and if poſſible thus to bury him alive.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> Knight, a Member of the Honourable Houſe of Commons, is without cauſe incenſed a gainſt Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and labours his ruine by all the wayes and means he can; and now at a publike meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Committee for Iriſh Affairs in <hi>London,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:169298:66"/>is a Member, the ſaid Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> ſpeaking contemptuouſly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefully of Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> unto many others of the Members of the Committee, uttered theſe words and ſpeeches to them, of him, ſaying, That Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> was a perjured perſon, and that he had been fined for Perjury and Forgery in the Star-Chamber, further ſaying, That he was unworthy to ſit amongſt them, and wondered that they would ſo much as admit him into their Company; whereupon at the next meeting of the ſaid Committee at <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall the 18 of <hi>November,</hi> 1643. the ſaid Committee enformed Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> thereof, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, that he would forbear ſitting amongſt them, untill he ſhould have purged himſelf of the ſaid Accuſations, and withall ſent unto Sir <hi>John Clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy,</hi> that he would be pleaſed to produce the ſaid Sentence, by which the truth of his Allegations might appear, or otherwiſe they ſhould have no reaſon to out Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> of the imployment amongſt them, and thereupon the ſaid Committee conceived this Order following.</p>

                        <p>VVHereas by the Order of the <hi>18.</hi> of <hi>November</hi> inſtant, for the Reaſons therein alledged, we entreated Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> (being one of our Members) to forbear ſitting with us, being then accuſed by Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> Knight, to be a Perjured perſon, and that he had been fined for Perjury and Forgery in the Star-Chamber; And whereas the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> was by us enterated to produce ſuch Records and proofs of theſe things as might ſatisfie this Committee of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169298:67"/>the truth of theſe Charges againſt him; but inſtead of ſuch proof and Records, the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> and other, ſitting at <hi>Goldſmiths</hi> Hall, as a Committee of the Houſe of Commons, for <hi>Iriſh</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, (where ſome of us were then preſent, as private men) did cauſe the Copy of a Sentence given againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> in His Majeſties Court of Star-Chamber, in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Terme, in the ſecond yeer of His Majeſties Reign, for to be produced and read, with the Copy of a pardon of ſome part of the Sentence, procured by Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> Father in law, in his abſence in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which Were then moved to ſatisfie the truth of the former Charges, and further preſſed as a Crime, for which he was unworthy to be of the ſaid Committee, and preſſed us to have joyned with them to have voted him out, for ſitting any longer amongſt us; but having heard the ſaid Sentence read, we finde no ſuch thing as Forgery or Perjury in the buſineſſe, if the Sentence were juſt; but is for the ſuppoſed defacing, and blotting out of two words <hi>(that</hi> and <hi>did)</hi> out of Paper Copy of a Depoſition uſed againſt one <hi>Yates,</hi> at a hearing wherein Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff againſt the ſaid <hi>Yates</hi> in that Court: And albeit, we will not take upon us for to judge the ſaid Sentence, yet we conceive it founded upon very weak grounds, there being neither Bill, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or <hi>ore tenus,</hi> for the manner of the proceeding, nor proof againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> to convince him of the Fact, for which he is ſentenced, and his Oath three ſeverall times ſworn for his purgation in the very sentence appearing, and many other miſcarriages in the Sentence by him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, which we leave to be judged in his proper place. But for this cauſe, and fora much as we do conceive it, not to be in our power, that one Member ſhould vote out another, being firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame Election of the body of Adventurers with our ſleves, and ſetled with us, by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, which we conceive not in our power to alter; and becauſe we hold it not agreeable to juſtice, that any man ſhould be condemned before he be firſt heard to anſwer for himſelf, and the matter be tried, whether it be right or wong. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as upon the producing of the pardon of the main part of the Sentence, we bold it not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of Law, or Religion, That if the Sentence had been juſt, yet that afterwards, the ſame thing ſhould be objected again againſt him, as a tranſgreſſion; upon all which matter, We do for our parts declare, That we have no juſt cauſe any longer to reſtrain Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> from ſitting amongſt us, according to the lawfulneſſe of his Election, and the rather becauſe nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us to prove him guilty of any thoſe heavy Charges, Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthy</hi> hath laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, nor of any crime or offence Whatſoever, deſerving our ill opinions, of whoſe good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour and great ſervice amongſt us, we are well ſatisfied; And have therefore Ordered, That the ſaid Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhall again take his place amongſt us, and ſit, and Vote, and Act toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with us as formerly he hath done, any former Orders to the contrary by us made heretofore, in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</p>

Anſwered, My God hath ſent his Angel, and hath ſhut the Lions mouthes, that they have not hurt me, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as before him innocency was found in me; and alſo before thee O king, have done no hurt, for he delivereth and reſerveth, and he worketh ſigns and wonders in Heaven and in Earth, who hath delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the power of the Lions, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> endured this great ſcandall alſo with ſilence, untill that the Iriſh Affairs might be ſetled, that ſo he might give no diſturbance to the proceedings, with reſolution afterwards to ſeek his remedy; and this failing to work that effect, for which it was intended, the proſecution ſeaſed not here, for then he muſt be yet again convented, but for executing of that power given to the Committee of <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall, whereof he was a Member, by the Honourable Committee of both Kingdoms, to do ſervice for the State, in finding out, and ſending away for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuch Goods as had been bought and paid for ſome yeers before, with the Adventures Money and lay here and there in ſeverall Stores and Houſes ſpoiling, which were worth 5000l. or thereabout; and which at laſt, the ſaid Committee ſent for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Forces in <hi>

                        <p>ACcording to your Honours Order the 25. of this inſtant <hi>Iune,</hi> we have conſidered of Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthies</hi> demands in the paper annexed, and do finde, that there are in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtores of goods now in our Poſſeſſion, 3. cheſts which are marked 1.3.4. wherein ther eare ſo many Muskets and Belts as are ſpecified in the Note; and that in another cheſt, number 8. there are the Bandeleers and Knapſacks which are alſo mentioned in the Noate, and the letters <hi>I. C.</hi> alſo made upon them; and we alſo finde that in another cheſt, number 4. there are ſo many Backs, Breſts, and Pots as are alſo mentioned in the Noate, but no letters of <hi>I. C.</hi> appeares upon them; there are alſo many Saddles in the ſtores, and Carbines, Swyvels, Cartriges, far exceeding the number mentioned in the Noate, but no ſuch letters of <hi>I. C.</hi> or mark ſet upon them as is expreſſed. And we humbly certifie, that aout this time twelve moneth, the Committee at <hi>Grocers Hall</hi> were very much perſwaded by Sir <hi>John Clotworthy</hi> to provide Armes, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Victuals for 5000. Foot, and 500. horſe, of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments then in <hi>Ulſter,</hi> aſſuring the ſaid Committee, being thus furniſhed, they would march out of that Province, for to fall upon the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels in the Provinces of that Kingdome; all which were provided and ſent accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, ſaving the particulars aforementioned, which were left behinde, becauſe the ſhip that carries thoſe proviſions, could not ſtow them in her: Sir <hi>John Clothworthy</hi> cauſed the ſame Armes to be divided here before they went, and every Regiment to have his proportion alotted; which he cauſed a ſervant of his own to ſee put up, and ſent away; but we have not from that time underſtood that the ſaid deſign hath been ſince purſued, or that any thing hath been ſince done in that ſervice, albeit all thoſe Armes and proviſions ſent were delivered accordingly; whereof we the rather remain ignorant, for that ſince the ſaid ſhip went away, the ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169298:70"/>Clotworthy</hi> came little amongſt us; but the Committee did put themſelves 3000. pound in debt, to make thoſe proviſions over and above 6. or 7000. pound more, which the ſaid Armes &amp;c. coſt. We leave it to your honours conſideration, if now Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> can pretend to the Armes that deſign for which they were provided, not being purſued: Howſoever this Committee crave leave for to informe your honours, concerning your former Orders to us directed for gathering in ſuch Armes and Goods as were formerly provided for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not ſent away, That <hi>Alderman Bunce</hi> had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſtores at <hi>Grocers hall,</hi> 126. Snaphaunce-Muskets, and there was in the hands of our Officer <hi>Francis Taylour,</hi> 20. Snaphaunce-Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets more, which were paid for with the money that was brought in by the Adventurers for lands in <hi>Ireland:</hi> Theſe we demanded according to your Honours Orders, and 40. Hand-mills of one <hi>Moreton,</hi> which were provided for the Army in <hi>Ulſter;</hi> and to pay for which, and for 70. paire of Holſters, Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthy</hi> did receive of the ſaid Adventurers money 144.1.10. s. (which hand-mills and Holſters are in Sir <hi>Iohn Clotworthyes</hi> hands (as we are informed) for <hi>Moreton</hi> affirmeth ſo much to us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the hand-mills: and thus we humbly conceive that <hi>Sir Iohn</hi> hath now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived 47. Muskets more than his ſhare of the 5000. Foot-Armes: We finde no ſpeciall direction of them for him; but this we know, that he received 24. paire of Piſtols, or thereabouts, and 65. Carbines and party-peeces more then any other of the Troops of Horſe had there: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he was pleaſed for to informe us at that time, that he had a Troop of horſe there in pay, yet ſince we are given to underſtand, that one Sir <hi>William Brownlow</hi> Knight, Commands that Troop to which he pretendeth, and is one of thoſe Troops appointed for to be Commanded by the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Army there: ſo that we leave it to your Honours conſideration, if in this Caſe the ſaid Horſe Armes by him demanded do not more properly belong to the ſaid Sir <hi>William Brownlow.</hi> All which we leve to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours graver Judgements.</p>

                  <p>And Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> is confident, if he would have deſired a Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate from the Committee of Goldſmiths-hall, of his carriage amongſt them, he could have procured a like manifeſtation of his good demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in that ſervice; but becauſe it concerneth another imployment, he hath been ſilent in it: But thus you may perceive further, what ill mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hee hath had, and what oppoſition hee hath undergone; and for no other cauſe or reaſon that he is conſcious of unto himſelf, if not for acting his part in the affairs wherein he hath been truſted, with that fidelity and zeal, that becomes an honeſt man: And to the beſt of his underſtanding, in all the courſe of his life, the malice and proſecution that hee hath met withall, have been for no other cauſe, but that hee would never be drawn to betray any truſt committed to his charge, for any gain, or tender of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> think much at this uſage, ſeeing it is but the ſame thing which others ſufer with himſelfe; and is that hath been, and it is that which ſhall be? And that which is doen, is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the Sun, <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 1.9.</p>
                  <p>But after all this, it hath been objected ſurther; But what hath been done for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſince Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath been of that Committee for <hi>Iriſh</hi> affairs? It is not poſſible for any man to think that it lay in his power, to do more then his own perſonall endeavours could contribute: and that he may put the queſtion, in anſwer of this demand; What hath he left undone, that any wayes lay in his power to do, and promote for the good and well-fare of that Kingdom, or of any His Majeſties Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? Nay, ever ſince his coming for <hi>England,</hi> after his eſcape from thoſe blood-thirſty Rebelsin <hi>Ireland,</hi> he hath ſpent his whole time, and that means which he hath received from his friends, in that ſervice, and both publikely, and privately hath laboured by all the poſſible wayes he could, to have relieved it: and <hi>Ultra poſſe non eſt eſſe.</hi> Let any man inſtance in any thing that he hath done, to the leaſt prejudice of the proceedings, and if he cannot anſwer for himſelf, let him bee condemned; if that bee not ſo tearmed wherein he hath oppoſed thoſe things which inall likely hood and appearance, muſt have left the Forces, and poor Proteſtants there, in a farre worſe condition, then (bleſſed be God) now they are in. It is a Rule, that <hi>Contraria juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt;</hi> By telling you perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, what he hath not done, you may happily give a gueſſe, at that which hath followed upon his endeavours.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all then, he doth profeſſe, That he hath not carried two faces in one Hood, but in whatſoever Debates, where he hath had the freedom to deliver himſelf, and his opinion, hee hath done it with ſingleneſſe of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169298:75"/>heart, cleerly without reſpect of perſons: he hath made the cauſe of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation both in Church and State, the ſole aim of his intentions, and Byas of his actions, and in the proſecution hereof, hath never ſwerved to the right hand, or to the left, &amp; for his part hath ſtill enclined that way which his judgment hath led him unto, and that might promote this the beſt, and bring it unto perfection with moſt expedition; and hath been ever of this opinion to love truth, though in the courſeſt garments: he hath never been ſo far wedded to his will, but that he could ſubmit to any one when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced with reaſon; and if upon good grounds, he hath conceived any one, of what Nation ſoever, better able to do the work, then his own Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he hath preferred him in his eſteem, as fitteſt to beimployed in ſuch a time as this, all <hi>punctillio's</hi> of honour, and by-reſpects whatſoever not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: he hath not clawed any one with Court-holy water, ſmooth language, whom he hath underſtood to have been an enemy to this Cauſe of God, of what quality, or condition ſoever, but hath delivered his ſenſe freely in thoſe things wherewith he hath been truſted, whoſoever hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, though <hi>veritas odium parit:</hi> he hath not acted for his own intereſt wherein he hath been employed, otherwiſe then involved in the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Cauſe, with all others; knowing, that if the Publike ſuffers, it is not any mans private intereſt that can be conſiderable: He hath not been craving the employment wherein he hath laboured all this while, nor hath had other Reaſon to move him to it, but a free Calling, and his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt defires &amp; affections to advance the buſineſſe: He hath not been led to this by a popular ſpirit, or from a deſire any ways to lift himſelf up in the opinion of the world; and ſhall be as well content to reſt from his labours, as he hath been for to perform his duty, if he ſhall be once by the ſame power ſet aſide, as uſeleſſe and unſerviceable, by which he acteth, and by which he was called to it: he hath neither gained, nor claimed 40000 <hi>l.</hi> for his ſervice, but hath loſt a Fortune, by the Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> worth half that ſame, and all the Eſtate he had, and therefore hath deſerved ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and yet whereas others have taſted liberally of the bounty of the Parliament, out of thoſe Collections made for the relief of the poor diſtreſſed Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> hee hath yet never received peny of that Charity, nor hath in the leaſt been burthenſome to the Parliament, but hath lived by that which he hath truely laboured for, and ſpent as much more in their ſervice, that hath been given him of his friends: Hee hath not been Linſey-Wolſey in his Religion, nor hath profeſſed to more ſides then the right, ſo neer as he was able to apprehend the truth, for to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him in any action, or thing, that hath not been juſt and equitable; nor hath he by a ſpecious and ſeeming ſanctity, endeavoured to cover over a double iniquity, hee hath not filled his purſe with unlawfull gain, nor hath kept from others that which is their due, when power and menas, and that which hath been rightly belonging unto ſuch, hath been put into his hands, for their ſatisfaction; nor hath complained, nor made uſe of the neceſſities of others, to ſupply his own occaſions, whiles theſe indeed have been in a ſtarving and periſhing condition: he hath had neither place nor Office, under colour whereof he could fill his Coffers, and yet never do duty, nor wait upon the ſervice: He hath hated to bee accompted a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liar, or a ſlanderer of his neighbour: Hee hath not maliciouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169298:75"/>any mans ruine, nor hath whiſpered in ſecret that, of any man behind his back, which he hath been aſhamed to juſtifie unto his face; he hath not been like a wilde Aſſes Colt, that hath kickt the dam, that hath given it ſuck; he hath not deceived the truſt repoſed in him, nor been but what he hath ſeemed to be; he never was accuſed to have laboured for the enlargement of any Rebel, under colour that he ſhould do ſervice for the Parliament; he never held Intelligences with any the Parliaments oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites in <hi>Oxford</hi> nor elſe-where; he could never fawn like a Spannel, flatter like a Fox, imitate like an Ape, change like a Camelion, nor devour like a Lion; and if it were not that he hates to be the Trumpet of his own praiſe, he could ſay ſomething of himſelf, which he will therefore forbear, onely relate all in this one generall, that he hath never been wanting to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute whatſoever hath lyen in his power, and within the Verge of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to promote the welfare of that, and theſe Kingdomes; and hath ſpent many houres, and dayes, and moneths, ſome years in managing thoſe affaires, and amongſt others hath ſerved the Parliaments commands therein faithfully and conſtantly, and with ſo much ſucceſſe as the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the time, the Ceſſation of Armes there in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the great oppoſition which he hath met withall in theſe proceedings, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and ſuffer: and becauſe he hath been charged, that he hath endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heretofore to have drawn over the monies collected for the poor Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in <hi>Holland</hi> hither, thereby to have diverted that charity into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther channell, and by the imployments of the monies here, to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged ſome mans private intereſt; he doth profeſſe, he hath been ſo far averſe to that way, as underſtanding from the firſt, that it was the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Donours of that liberality, that it ſhould be onely ſent over for <hi>Ireland</hi> in Victuall, that with the reſt of the Committee at <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall, he hath laboured to keepe a right underſtanding therein, with the States and Claſſes of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and to prevent all ſuſpitions of miſ-applying their bounty, otherwiſe than they intended it, and when ſome letters were written over by ſome from hence to that purpoſe, which ſtaggered them in their ſaid proceeding, the ſaid Committee of <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall ſo carefully waded in it, with them, as they took off the jealouſies thus raiſed, and have procured a large collection and contribution there, which hath been ſent in Victuall to the poor Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> amounting unto neer 30000. l. which hath been ſuch a Reviving unto them, as ſome of them of <hi>Ulſter</hi> have profeſſed, that they had not otherwiſe been able to have ſubſiſted all this while: and if any ſuch thing hath been doen, ſurely it hath not been by the Committee of <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall, or Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the enſuing Order may poſſibly manifeſt, which was directed to Maſter <hi>Deacon,</hi> Clerk to the ſaid Committee of Adventurers, to have taken the buſineſſe out of their hands.</p>

                  <p>But what was meant by this, <hi>Maſter Alexander</hi> profeſſeth he knoweth not, but he conceiveth well, and that it was to have managed the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in a better way, than they at <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall have done; but he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it hath excuſed him from that Accuſation, and to thoſe that have blamed him in this particular, who hath no wayes been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by it in the leaſt farthing, but hath contributed all his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that might poſſibly promote the buſineſſe; and whoſoever wrote to that State, to draw over the monies hither to be imployed here, he can waſh his hands in innocency, he hath had no finger in it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he remembreth ſomething hath been written from thence to the ſaid Committee at <hi>Grocers</hi> Hall, informing ſuch a thing to have been done, and admiring the deſire of it, for that the States and Claſſes had Ordered otherwiſe from the beginning; and that whatſoever monies ſhould be thus Collected, ſhould be onely imployed to buy Victuall, and to tranſport thither, which hath been ſince done to ſuch a value as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>And now if you pleaſe, you may obſerve from all that hath gone before, the ſtate and condition in which Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath lived ever ſince he came to Act in this world, that as 'tis ſaid, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.4. <hi>The Dragon ſtood before the woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devoure her child ſo ſoon as it was born:</hi> ſo he came no ſooner abroad to trade and traffique amongſt men, but he found the ſtream and Current of the times, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to run very ſtrong and violently againſt him, and ever ſince he hath been enforced to ſaile both againſt winde and tide, that he could never yet with Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attain to the faire Havens, unto the deſired place where he would be, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.30. yet hath God many times made theſe ſtormes to be calmes, ſo that the waves thereof have been ſometimes ſtill and quiet, but like a Ram fallen backward, to give the greater Butt in their comming on again; and the ſtormy winds and tempeſts, which hath lifted up theſe waves on high, have brought him to his wits ends, and have even melted his ſpirits, becauſe of the troubles; yet he doth confeſſe, when he hath cryed unto the Lord in theſe afflictions, he hath ſaved him out of theſe diſtreſſes, <hi>Therefore doth he praiſe him for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and for the wonderfull workes which he doth unto the children of men:</hi> you may alſo perceive Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath ſtill been upon the defenſive part and hath laboured under the oppreſſions of thoſe with whom he hath had to do, and it hath been his ill hap evermore to be purſued by ſuch as have been too ſtrong and mighty for him, that he can truely ſay with <hi>Iſrael, Pſal.</hi> 129. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, yet they have not prevailed againſt me; the Plowers plowed upon my back, and have made long fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169298:76"/>but the righteous Lord hath hewen their ſnares in peeces:</hi> you know the report of great ones, muſt render a man ſuſpected at leaſt, though never ſo innocent, if not diſtaſtfull to that ſort of people, who beleeve things as they are informed of them by their ſuperiours, whom they truſt, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry authority with them to cry down any mans merits, though never ſo worthy, and can ſtick upon him ſcandalous imputations, though undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and if it be thus, how much ſooner will things be credited, which are done by colour of Juſtice, and as if they had the ſtamp, and an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of truth ſet upon them, by the powerfull hands of Authority, which in thoſe times admitted of neither diſpute or contradiction, nor was there any way left to repair innocence thus abuſed: and for a cloſe of all, be pleaſed to re-collect theſe obſervations from the whole matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Sentence thus given againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion taken, as for a thing long waited for, and reſolved upon before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to be put in Execution with the firſt opportunity; and then ſee how eaſie a thing it is to finde a ſtaffe to beat a dog.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> attempting now at his firſt comming into the world, to repair himſelf againſt the wrong done him by Maſter <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> as aforeſaid, he being a Popiſh adverſary; yet of great eſteem and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt in his Country, as deſcended from ſo famous a Lawyer as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in his Generation, allyed to many Ancient families there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by all the Gentry: Therefore, and for not complying with the times, and refuſing to betray the truſt repoſed in him; and by reaſon of the many Stewardſhips which he had, and therein having to deal with very many of the beſt Gentry of that County, that held of thoſe Lordſhips by Service and Rent, the performance and payment whereof, he now more ſtrictly required, the ſame being almoſt extinguiſhed by the connivance or negligence of his predeceſſors exerciſing that Office; and having therein alſo to deal with a rude multitude of the poorer ſort of people, who for ſmall and petty debts, were dayly ſued in thoſe Courts, whoſe very neceſſities did raiſe clamour, though juſtly proceeded againſt, and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> in the courſe of his calling, in the very beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being much imployed for the inferiour ſort of people and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly againſt the greateſt, wherein he did evermore performe his duty with all the power and faithfulneſſe he was able, and evermore with good ſucceſſe, which he hath continued to do unto this day, he doubteth not but all indifferent men will judge, that it was not poſſible for him to live without being envyed, ſcandalized, and queſtioned: though in all you may perceive he ſtill acquitted himſelf; <hi>For he that doth truth commeth to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God, and the truth ſhall make him free, Joh.</hi> 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That this Sentence was then given with a ſpirit of prejudication and reſolution beforehand, taken howſoever to condemn Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in this matter, doth appear by the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventrys</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in it, from firſt to laſt: wherein all the Officers in that Court acting under him, and to free one of themſelves, carryed on the ſame more ſmoothly, and ſo made it a thing almoſt impoſſible for Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to eſcape their fingers: birds of one feather, flying altogether to the prey; which is more remarkable in the particulars following.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> his readineſſe to embrace the leaſt hint
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169298:77"/>and occaſion offered to charge M. <hi>Alexander</hi> with this Accuſation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it hath appeared unto you herein before that he was innocent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That upon the firſt Motion, though out of Court, his Lordſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly releaſed <hi>Yates,</hi> who ſtood fined in Court, and was then in cuſtody upon a Cenſure, appearing to have been juſtly given againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the ſaid Lord Keeper, being the ſupreme Judge of that Court, and in order unto his place, directing all Cauſes in the manner of their proceeding unto Judgment, his Lordſhip gave Rules and Orders in this matter, againſt all the Rules and Orders of that Court.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thus hee irregularly admitted of an Oath in this Cauſe for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front an Oath, contrary to all practiſe and the duty of a good Judge, for that where an Oath is once received, and upon Record in a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, an other Oath in the Negative, hath never been admitted, point-blank in oppoſition to the former; The onely Remedy in ſuch Caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Bill, or Information, that all parties concerned, may interplead the matter in difference, and thereupon right and juſtice to bee done, where the fault is found.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That where the Accuſation hath been once anſwered upon Oath, in the particulers of the Charge, it is againſt the ordinary rules of all Courts of Juſtice, for to re-examine that party again, upon thoſe very things to which he hath preciſely anſwered; yet did the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> you ſee, enforce Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> twice to anſwer that thing over again upon his Oath, which he had punctually anſwered once before, nay once publiquely in Court interrogated by himſelf, and after that again by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Judges, by him principally directed, which was onely done to have drawn from him ſome guilt, if poſſible, whereby to have ruined and undoned him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It hath been never ſeen in any Court of Juſtice, that the party com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, hath been bound up in the matter complained of, by the Oath of any Defendant, without his own conſent; yet in this Caſe <hi>Nevill</hi> being legally charged with committing of the ſaid offence, was received by the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> for to purge himſelf upon his Oath, without any conſent had, or ſought for of Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> and in an extrajudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall way alſo, and made uſe of it afterwards as a teſtimony upon which to ground the Sentence, having nothing more to ſupport it withall.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In all Bills and Informations exhibited in that Court, the Cauſe being ſo penall to the party complained againſt, the matter ought to have been ſet down truely, and as preciſely as in an Indictment, that ſo the party accuſed, might have certainty to what to anſwer; for if one offence bee charged, and another proved, in ſuch caſe there is no ground for to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant a Sentence, nor hath it been ſeen that any man, in any Court what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, hath been concluded by generals, nor by offences proved which are <hi>heterogenia,</hi> and not of the matter in queſtion; for ſo to judge, is to judge <hi>parte inandita ultera;</hi> for if this ſhould be admitted, no man poſſibly could be ſafe, if to be judged for that, which he hath been never received to anſwer, yet the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> admitted of both theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to condemn Maſter <hi>Alexander:</hi> For firſt, hee received the ſaid <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Cooke</hi> to depoſe matter in Court againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and from the things in queſtion, and cauſed that to bee inſerted in the Sentence, as convincing teſtimony, which you ſee is a thing falſe in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:169298:77"/>it ſelf now it comes to be defended; He admitted of divers generals alſo not proved, nor before alleadged, to be inſerted in the ſaid Sentence, as matter of teſtimony to ſupport it, which were farre otherwiſe in truth, and deed, then they ſtand therein urged, and preſſed; and which are ſo many of them, as that in effect the whole Sentence is founded upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, moſt illegally and unwarrantably.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Whereas no man after his Anſwer in Court, but is lawfully ſerved with an Order, or Proceſſe, to joyne iſſue in the matter controverted, or depending, and after iſſue joyned, is called by Proceſſe, or Order, for to appear at a certain day, and time, to hear judgement pronounced, and to make his juſt defence, that ſo innocence may not ſuffer, if poſſibly to bee prevented: but in this Caſe of Maſter <hi>Alexanders,</hi> the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> proceeds to judgements, without doing of either of theſe; and yet to give ſome colour for this wrong doing, and to make quick work of it, hee overſhadows it with another thing, an errour of as high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and receives that for a ſervice of Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> to hear judgement, which hath appeared to have been no ſervice at all, and that in ſeven dayes time, from the day that the Judges certificate was firſt produced, and read in Court, and then Reſolved upon the firſt to draw this matter unto a formall hearing, it is concluded to be proceeded in, is debated, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, and M. <hi>Alexander</hi> deſtroyed without defence; and what needed all this poſt-haſt, if not to have made it onely the advantage of deſtroying him in his abſence? In which way, they were ſure to bring about their ends.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. That upon the matter, he directs in the Sentence, the Governours of <hi>Lincolns-Inne,</hi> whereof Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was a Member, to expell him the Society, fearing leſt he ſhould not be otherwiſe made miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and that they might without that hint or direction, by the way, have forborn to have proceeded againſt him, with a like ſeverity, but by this Weathercock, you may ſee where the Winde blew, and that malice when it rageth, is without bounds, or reſtraint; and now with holy <hi>Job, Chap.</hi> 19.7. I might cry out of wrong, but I was not heard; I cried out aloud, but there was no judgement.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. That the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> after the queſtion was once ſtirred, never ſo much as once endeavoured afterwards to ſupport the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence given againſt <hi>Yates,</hi> though upon ſo good proof appearing in the Books, the ſaid Depoſition of <hi>John Warren,</hi> being ſet aſide, but abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſmiſſed <hi>Yates,</hi> without more ado, contrary to the duty of his Place, and Office; whereby it is further manifeſt, it was not for his love and zeal unto juſtice, but revenge, that he herein more aymed at, was the cauſe that he perſecuted M. <hi>Alexander</hi> with ſo much extremity.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. That he was not ignorant, that the crime objected was in it ſelf petty, and without conſideration, in caſe it had been the Act of M. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> (as you finde him cleered of it, in that which hath gone before) and therefore it further ſheweth the inveteracy of his rancor, and for what cauſe he was ſo violent in the perſecution of M. <hi>Alexander,</hi> thus unjuſty unto Sentence.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> was reſolved, you may ſee by the exceſſiveneſſe and immoderation of the Fine, and other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be performed by the Sentence, to make it finall and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169298:78"/>and ſo heavy and burthenſome, as that Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again be able to riſe from under it; for thus he diſinabled him in his eſtate, in his profeſſion, in his good name, in his friends, and made what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever uncomfortable to him which this life could afford; that thus upon the matter he had buried him alive, which to have compleated, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but execution, an Officer, to have caſt him into the grave, the priſon appointed, from whence he ſhould have been ſure, in his time, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have returned, till he ſhould have paid the uttermoſt farthing, and performed whatſoever he required to have been done.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. That he ſeconded <hi>Yates</hi> his diſmiſſion with another Act of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as grievous as any of the reſt: he received a Bill of coſts from <hi>Yates</hi> his Atturney, which had a foundation anſwerable to the building, falſe gloſſes upon the Text, a Title appearing as untrue, as the particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were unjuſtly multiplied; with an addition too in the <hi>Summa totalis,</hi> more then juſtifiable, or contained in the Summes that went before, another brat of the ſame breeding; thus rowling one ſtone more over his grave, that ſo there might be weight enough to have kept him under ground.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. That by his meanes no inſtallment of the Fine muſt bee in Maſter <hi>Alexanders</hi> Caſe, which was a mercy admitted to all others in like conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to ſuch whoſe offences were proved Capitall, and tranſcendent indeed, and this Fine muſt be begged, and paid, and all other ſummes of money which he had adjudged to be paid by M. <hi>Alexander</hi> in that Court: and was not this yet more grievous and intollerable, and done out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to him?</p>
                  <p n="18">18. That he vowed, he would not admit of any Pardon to paſſe under the great Seal for Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> of the ſaid Sentence, ſo long as hee was Keeper of it, which in part he performed, and with much trouble to his patience, and grief of his heart (as you ſee it prooved) it was, that he permitted any thing to paſſe at all, and if his power had not been imployed for a cloak of his maliciouſneſſe, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16. what had it been to him, had he ſtood indifferently affected, that after the Sentence paſt, and that the Law had had its courſe, that his Majeſty ſhould not bee as mercifull to M. <hi>Alexander,</hi> as to any other of his Subjects, you may underſtand the cauſe of his fear, was the palpable injuſtice in theſe his Actions, and that if M. <hi>Alexander</hi> ſhould acquire any means and liberty for himſelf, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his ſpirit too great to put up ſuch an injury at his hands, when any opportunity ſhould be offered to attempt the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. That he gave the ſaid diſmiſſion for <hi>Yates</hi> againſt Maſter <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and awarded 130. pound Coſts againſt him, when it appeared unto him by ſuch proof as had been made, that M. <hi>Alexander</hi> had <hi>probabilem cauſam littigandi,</hi> and much more, and therefore by the courſe of that Court ought to have paid no Coſts, which further anſwers that objection; That the Petitioner ſhould commit the fact for his own advantage, when no benefit could have accrewed to him by it at all, there being ſufficient teſtimony beſides to prove the Charge, and it had been an Act of great folly in M. <hi>Alexander</hi> to have done ſuch a thing, which muſt of neceſſity have been controuled in Court, both by the Record, and the Defendants Copy of the ſaid Depoſition, and who can beleeve he would do that Act in ſecret, which he had endeavoured to make publique, by the mark like a hand ſet againſt it in the margent of the Copy for examination of it, and which of neceſſity muſt diſcover it.</p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:169298:78"/>
                  <p n="20">20. And if the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> had not been more engaged in it than ordinary, why would he have preſſed a matter of no more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or dammage, either to the State or any other perſon than this was, and carried it on with ſo high a hand and ſuch violence, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one of his own coat, whoſe infirmities, if he had found any in him, he ſhould therefore the rather have endeavoured to have concealed in the birth of his profeſſion in hope of amendment, than thus for to proceed without mercy or moderation, I am ſure herein he did not immitate his heavenly Father in mercy, who forgiving thouſands of Talents, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we ſhould not for Pence, take our Neighbours by the throat, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32, 33, 34, 35.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. He ſuffered the Sentence to be interlaced with much ſcandalous and impertinent matter, meerly ſuggeſted to render M. <hi>Alexander</hi> cauſleſly odious, to all that ſhould onely read it and underſtand no more: and we ſay it is an eaſie thing to make a man of ſtraw, and kill him when we have done; and if it may be admitted to inſert without proof or warrant, what a mans Adverſary, and his Councill can invent, to make ſomething of nothing, whereby to charge his enemies; I wounder who it is in ſuch caſe can be ſafe from deſtruction, or that can think his life and eſtate is not every minute in danger, and when the ſaid Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry,</hi> who had firſt the peruſuall of all Sentences given in that Court, did permit this Sentence to be ſtuffed up with ſuch untruths: Is he blameleſſe herein for doing to Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> an intollerable injury and oppreſſion?</p>
                  <p n="22">22. When he obſerved no Order, in this proceeding, which is the life of Government; and where there is no Order, there is confuſion, it is a Rule then in all Caſes criminall, if the ſuppoſed Delinquent deny the fact objected, no proſecution ſhould be made againſt him, without Bill or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, Anſwer and Examination of Witneſſes; ſo that the Party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed might make his juſt Defence: of all theſe Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> was deprived and debarred, and yet the Sentence ſupported by his only power and greatneſſe, as if it had been the moſt juſt one, that ever was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. You may alſo perceive what uſe of it hath been made from time to time, againſt Maſter <hi>Alexander,</hi> by all thoſe his oppoſites, with whom he hath had to do, perverting it to ſerve their own turnes for his diſgrace; and though it be penned with as much aſperity, and diſadvantage unto his Caſe; and filled with as many falſities as there are lines, yet becauſe it came not high enough, it muſt be reported to be far otherwiſe, and worſe then it is in it ſelf: which the late Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and now, Sir <hi>John Clotworthy,</hi> have been pleaſed to extend far beyond whatſoever is contained in it: and all which you ſee Maſter <hi>Alexander</hi> hath hitherto ſuffered with a great deal of patience, but doth now hope the time is come that his Caſe is known, and if yet he ſhall not finde redreſſe of his ſufferings, he is ſo well inured to beare the burthen of theſe Calamities, as he will yet reſt in hope, that, that God which hath all this time prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him, and kept him from deſtruction, will either here, or hereafter, or in both, ſatisfie him with his goodneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. That Court of Star-Chamber it ſelf in the exerciſe of it in thoſe times, was not ſo pure, and cleer from queſtion and exception, both that it was by this Honourable Parliament found to be a great grievance, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169298:79"/>vexatious to the Subject, and therefore diſſolved it, the Judges of that Court not keeping themſelves to the points limitted by the Statute, by which it ſtood principally founded and erected, but did puniſh where no law did warrant, and made decrees for things where they had no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and did inflict heavier puniſhment then by any law was warranted and contrary to the great Charter, and was a meanes to introduce an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power and Government, And therefore no wonder, if he that was an honeſt man, and lived in any way averſe unto thoſe times and their proceedings, extreamly ſuffered under its cenſures, but we have ſeen the end of theſe blazing and falling ſtars, who having deceived us all this while, have been reſolved into their Elements of earth and ſelf reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Thus a man that is conſtantly carried by true principles, though the compaſſe may through infirmity or Temptation ſometimes admit varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or wavering yet it recollects it ſelf again, and will promote to the true pole, what waves or winds ſoever beats againſt the ſhip, perſeverance in good things goeth never without its reward in the latter end, it did <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> no good that he was of the twelve, when once he fell away; for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any man good to lay a good foundation, if he build not a faire ſtructure upon it, for to begin in the Spirit and end in the fleſh; to ſet out good wine at the firſt and then that which is worſe, is the Devills banquet: I am confident of my innocence, I have produced my evidence, let the Reader judge, and I appeal to the ſearcher of hearts too; who will one day acquit me, and puniſh their uncharitableneſſe, that have condemned me by the meaſure of my ſufferings, and nothing elſe; but I hope that God who in juſtice hath laid on the burthen, will in mercy ſtill ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then my ſhoulders to ſupport it, and what my prayers and endeavours cannot prevent, my patience ſhall undergoe; yet let me crave this one thing at your hands, that if you finde herein, as <hi>Feſtus</hi> did of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 25.18.19. <hi>That his Accuſers ſtood up againſt him, and could prove no evill accuſation;</hi> you will with <hi>Pauls</hi> Judges (between your ſelves at leaſt) ſay of this man, <hi>That he hath done nothing worthy whereof he hath been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Acts</hi> 26.31.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Voluntas Dei ſecreta ſit nunquam injusta:</hi> the cauſe why God puniſheth may be hid, but it is never unjuſt, <hi>Therefore will I bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> Nehem. 9.33. Mich. 7.9.</p>
